<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
STALKING THE DEER.
</h3>

<p>
'I don't know what Olive will think, or
how she may view my loitering here, after
all these years of absence, instead of
hastening home to meet her; but, truth to
tell, the temptation to have a shot on the
purple heather after sweltering so long in
India was so great&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What does it matter what she thinks?'
interrupted the elder man, laughing.
'When two persons are to spend the whole
term of their natural lives together, they
can surely spare a few days for pleasure
apart!'
</p>

<p>
'But consider, I have not seen my little
<i>fiancée</i> for seven years.'
</p>

<p>
'You will find her a pretty tall <i>fiancée</i>
now,' replied the other, 'and as handsome
as any girl in Scotland, Allan.'
</p>

<p>
The speakers were Lord Aberfeldie (he
was viscount in the Peerage) and his son
Allan, the Master, then at home on leave
from the Black Watch, in which he was a
captain; and now, side by side, they were
creeping up a steep and stony corrie in
search of the red deer, but paused for a
few minutes to breathe and converse.
</p>

<p>
The Master&mdash;so entitled as the son of a
Scottish baron (we may add for the
information of most English readers even in
these days)&mdash;was, like his father, a tall
and soldier-like fellow, with closely-shorn
dark brown hair, straight features, and an
almost black moustache, which partly
concealed lips that were handsomely curved,
and expressive of no small degree of
firmness and decision.  He carried his head
erect, and spoke rather with the air of one
used to command when addressing men,
but with great and subtle softness when
conversing with women of every station
and degree; and already, under home
influences, his dark hazel eyes were losing
the keen and somewhat hawk-like expression
they had worn when daily facing
death and suffering on active service.
</p>

<p>
Both father and son were handsome,
though there were nearly thirty years
between them in age, and both were, from
head to foot, unmistakably thorough-bred
men&mdash;the latter tanned deeply by a tropical
sun, and his forehead scarred by a wound
from a tulwar blade.
</p>

<p>
Lord Aberfeldie, now above fifty, had
taken a turn of service for a few years in
the Black Watch till his succession to the
title required his presence at home, though
an enthusiastic soldier; and soon after his
place in the regiment which he loved so
well was taken by his only son and heir,
the Master, then fresh from college.
</p>

<p>
Father and son both wore plain shooting-kilts
and jackets of coarse heather-coloured
stuff, with handsomely-mounted
sporans and skeins; other ornaments they
had none, unless we except the crest of
Graham&mdash;their surname&mdash;an eagle taloning
a stork, in their glengarries; and the
peer, who was a keen fisherman, had his
head-dress further garnished by various
flies and old fish-hooks.
</p>

<p>
When <i>en route</i> home to the family seat
at Dundargue, in the Carse of Gowrie, the
Master had been tempted by his father to
join him at their shooting-box among the
lovely Perthshire hills, where, at present,
the party consisted of only four&mdash;Mr. Hawke
Holcroft, an English guest, and
Evan Cameron, a sub. of the Black Watch,
also on leave; and these two, attended by
a keeper and gillies, were creeping up
another corrie, rifle in hand, about half a
mile distant.
</p>

<p>
'You have had this&mdash;a&mdash;Mr. Holcroft
with you for some time at Dundargue!'
said Allan Graham, questioningly.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;for some weeks&mdash;before we came
up to the hills here.'
</p>

<p>
'He cannot know anything about the
implied engagement&mdash;that of Olive
Raymond with me?'
</p>

<p>
'Implied?'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;the peculiar arrangements that
exist under her father's eccentric
will.'
</p>

<p>
'Probably not&mdash;nay, undoubtedly not,'
replied his father, eyeing him keenly; 'it
is no business of his&mdash;so, whence the
question, Allan?'
</p>

<p>
'Because he showed me, rather
vauntingly, a very fine photo he keeps in his
pocket-book.'
</p>

<p>
'A photo of Olive?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'The deuce he does.  I have thought
her sometimes too <i>épris</i> with our horsey
friend Hawke Holcroft, and thus longed
for your return.  They renewed at
Dundargue, an acquaintance formed last
season in London, when Olive made some
sensation, I assure you; and, now that you
have seen her photo, what do you think of
her&mdash;pretty?'
</p>

<p>
'Pretty!  She is downright beautiful!'
</p>

<p>
'Ah&mdash;wait till you have seen her.  She
does credit to your mother's rearing and
her governess's tutelage; but you have
not exhibited much impatience hitherto.
Gad, when I was your age&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'You forget that she was such a child
when we parted,' interrupted Allan,
stroking out his long dark moustache.  'But
was it not rather cool of him to show me
her likeness?'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps; but then it was done in
ignorance of the situation, and it is
probably the result of some conservatory
flirtation.'
</p>

<p>
'But just as he showed it to me, was it
not strange that I heard the cry of a
plover overhead, and&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
Lord Aberfeldie interrupted his son by a
hearty laugh, and tossed away the end of
his cigar.
</p>

<p>
'After eight years' soldiering with the
Black Watch, do you actually retain the
superstition that the plover is a type of
inconstancy, and the bird of ill-omen
Burns, Scott, and Leyden describe it as
being?'
</p>

<p>
Allan laughed, too; but now, when
among his native mountains and the
scenes of his childhood, he could not help
old Scottish impressions returning to him,
though certainly the ranks of his regiment
were the last place in which he was
likely to forget them.
</p>

<p>
The silver-haired and silver-bearded old
game-keeper, Dugald Glas (whose real
name was Mackinnon), a hawk-eyed Celt,
with a weather-beaten visage, and bare
knees that were brown as mahogany, now
urged silence and no more smoking.  He
had discovered by the aid of his binoculars
a couple of deer grazing, but pretty
far apart, upon the hill-side; and once
again by private signal the two parties
began mutually their stealthy approach
upward in the two corries that concealed
them in the <i>forest</i>, for so it was called,
though destitute now of trees.
</p>

<p>
'A forest, as the word was strictly
taken in ancient times,' says Sir Thomas
Dick Lauder, 'could not be in the hands
of anyone but the king, yet in later periods
forests have become the property of
subjects, or have been erected by them,
though without being protected by forest
laws.  The royal forest in the Isle of
Wight, in which there is not a single
tree, is not the only English example
remaining of the view taken of this old
meaning of the word.'  Hence, he adds,
'Let not the Cockney suppose that the
word forest necessarily implies a district
covered with oaks, chestnuts, or trees of
any other description.'
</p>

<p>
A powerful and gigantic staghound,
wiry, sinewy, and iron-grey&mdash;the noble
dog that Landseer loved to depict&mdash;saw
the deer already without the aid of glasses
and strained hard upon his leash, an iron
chain, which was twisted round the muscular
wrist of the old keeper, who soothed
and patted him, while muttering in Gaelic,
'<i>Mar e Bran, is e braithair!</i>' (If it is not
Bran, it is his brother), alluding to Fingal's
favourite staghound, which he was thought
to resemble, as his hair was iron-grey, his
feet were yellow, with erect ears of a
ruddy tinge.
</p>

<p>
The forenoon was brilliantly clear, so
the deer-stalkers had not the weather to
contend with, as that, if untoward, may
render all strategy vain.
</p>

<p>
Lord Aberfeldie and his son were as
well aware as their skilled old keeper that
in stalking the chief things to regard are
the eyes and nose of the deer.  His vision,
quick as that of an eagle, can detect a
human head above a ridge of rock or belt
of bracken, and he can scent an intruder
on his 'native heath,' if the breeze blows
<i>from</i> the former, at a wonderful distance;
and old Dugald Glas, who had brought the
father and son to the forest at dawn with
us much care and secresy as if an assassination
was in hand, had long scanned the
vicinity with his glasses before he discovered
the stags in question, and gave the
concealed stalkers the signal to approach
them.
</p>

<p>
The two animals were rather far apart;
both were quietly feeding, and&mdash;as the
season was considerably advanced&mdash;both
in colour were marvellously like the grey
stone and brown heather around them,
and both were, as yet, all unalarmed as
Lord Aberfeldie, the Master, and Dugald
Glas, while pausing and holding ever and
anon a council of war in low whispers,
crept up the stony corrie, keeping carefully
to leeward of the quarry they had selected,
leaving Cameron of Stratherroch and
Hawke Holcroft to approach the other as
best they might; but it was in the present
instance absolutely necessary that both
parties should fire at the same instant, or
one of the stags would vanish at a gallop,
perhaps to the most distant limit of the
forest.
</p>

<p>
In crawling after such game the head
must be foremost when going up a hill,
and the feet foremost when going down,
and the stalker must creep on his stomach
and knees; and all this, when done in the
kilt, over rough rocks, sharply-pointed
heather, and mossy bog, is not to be
effected without considerable toil and even
discomfort.
</p>

<p>
Nearly an hour of this kind of work had
gone on, the father and son creeping side
by side, softly and in silence, dragging
their rifles after them, old Dugald following
in the same fashion, with Bran straining
on his iron chain; and once or twice
they had actually to traverse the bed of a
mountain burn that brawled hoarsely
downward over its brown-worn pebbles
and boulders.
</p>

<p>
The stag was still feeding quietly, and
all unconscious of the approach of death;
and the stalkers were, they thought, within
a safe distance now, and that it could not
escape them; so Dugald Glas dropped
behind, after whispering to the Master in
Gaelic,
</p>

<p>
'Blood upon the skein, Allan!'
</p>

<p>
Then the heart of the latter began to
beat highly as the moment for shooting
drew near, for after all their care and toil
it was quite possible that a grouse might
whirr up from the heather, and with a
warning cry scare the stag to full speed.
</p>

<p>
'You take aim, Allan,' whispered Lord
Aberfeldie, 'and I shall reserve my fire.
It is years since you had a shot at a dun
cow, my boy.'
</p>

<p>
Inch by inch the Master cautiously
inserted his double-barrelled rifle between
the stiff tufts of purple heather that fringed
the bank of the hollow up which they had
been creeping, and brought the sights to
bear upon the beautiful and graceful
animal that cropped the herbage, with his
branching antlers lowered; and Allan, in
the excitement of the moment, felt his
pulses beating wildly.
</p>

<p>
'If I miss&mdash;if I fail!' he muttered.
</p>

<p>
'Tut&mdash;-there is no such word as fail!'
replied his father, unconsciously quoting
'Richelieu.'
</p>

<p>
Allan drew a long breath, while his dark
eye seemed to flash along the barrel, and
fired.  Bang went a couple of rifles in the
distant corrie, but Aberfeldie and his son
took no heed of them.  The latter's single
shot had sped true, piercing the stag above
the left eye, and now it lay prone on the
heather, tearing up tufts and sandy earth
with its hoofs in the agonies of death.
</p>

<p>
Allan's skein-dhu was promptly in his
hand; the stag was <i>gralloched</i>, and Dugald
Glas, waving his bonnet, shouted loudly
for Alister Bane and Hector Crubach (or
lame Hector), two gillies, to bring up the
pony, on which the dead animal was slung,
and then the party set out for the place
appointed for luncheon, as raid-day was
now long since past.
</p>

<p>
'What the deuce are Stratherroch and
Holcroft about?' exclaimed Lord Aberfeldie,
while shading his eyes with his hand;
and to their success in sport we shall refer
in the next chapter.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
HAWKE HOLCROFT.
</h3>

<p>
The process of creeping in serpent fashion
over sharp-pointed heather, rough stones,
and occasionally in the bed of a mountain
stream, as we have already described,
proved intensely tiresome and distasteful
to a 'man about town' like Mr. Hawke
Holcroft, who could not entirely conceal
his genuine disgust thereat, and at the
slowness of the whole affair, though
reminded by Dugald's son Angus, a smart
young under-keeper, of the big hart of
Benmore, which was stalked for seven
long summer days before it was killed.
</p>

<p>
'But, for the Lord's sake, sir, keep quiet,'
whispered Angus.  'We are now close on
one of the finest of Macgilony's dun cows.'
</p>

<p>
'I see no dun cow!' grumbled Holcroft.
</p>

<p>
'He means yonder deer,' whispered
Cameron, a fair-haired and pleasant-looking
fellow.  'Macgilony was a famous
hunter in the olden time, and his dun
cows, as he called them, were the red
deer of the Grampians.'
</p>

<p>
But to Holcroft, whose idea of hunting
the stag was to have a scared and
bewildered creature&mdash;a fallow deer, fed on
oats and hay, perhaps&mdash;cast loose from a
game-cart in a smooth, grassy park, the
perseverance, courage, and labour required
for stalking in the Highlands seemed a
simple waste of time and an inconceivable
bore.
</p>

<p>
'Stop for a minute,' whispered Angus,
as they crept <i>up the wind</i>; 'the stag can
smell with more than its nostrils.'
</p>

<p>
As the stoppage took place directly in
the bed of a brawling burn, where they all
lay on their stomachs, Holcroft not
unnaturally asked, with no small irritation,
what he meant; and the wiry young Highlander,
who was whiskered and moustached
to such an extent that, with his shaggy
eyebrows, he somewhat resembled a Skye
terrier in visage, explained his theory&mdash;no
uncommon one, though, of course, not
admitted by naturalists&mdash;that the red deer
can both smell and breathe through the
curious aperture beneath each eye, even
if their heads are immersed in water
when in the act of drinking.
</p>

<p>
'Dioul!' muttered Angus, as they crept
forward again, but on dry heather this
time, 'we can't be too cautious, whateffer!
A deer's eye is as keen as an eagle's, and
his nose acute as that of a foumart.'
</p>

<p>
'The first shot shall be yours, Holcroft,'
said Cameron.  'I shall reserve my fire.
He seems a powerful animal, and, if you
only wound him, we may have the devil
to pay!'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks&mdash;but how?' whispered Holcroft.
</p>

<p>
'If the dogs bring him to bay, he may
turn upon us ere another cartridge can be
dropped in the barrel, and gore deep with
his horns.'
</p>

<p>
English sportsmen generally prefer having
the deer driven to stalking them, for the
bodily exertion requisite in the latter case
tries so severely every muscle and sinew;
but, to the true Highland hunter, one deer
shot after a long and adventurous stalk, is
worth a hundred knocked over after a
successful drive by gillies, when the herd
is urged in wild confusion through some
narrow pass well garrisoned by breech-loaders
in secure ambush.
</p>

<p>
While Holcroft and Cameron crept softly
forward nearer the browsing deer, the
young keeper threw his plaid over the eyes
of the staghound Shiuloch, and held it in
by main strength, though his wrist was
nearly dislocated by the strain of the leash,
and the ill-suppressed whimpers of the
animal were lost amid its muffling.
</p>

<p>
'Now,' whispered Angus, hoarsely, full
of excitement&mdash;'now is your time, sir!'
</p>

<p>
Holcroft took a long aim; in his intense
anxiety, and perhaps inspired by vanity,
he overdid his aim; he fired at the precise
moment Allan's shot was heard in the
distant corrie, but only wounded the stag
in the shoulder, and, just as he let fly the
contents of the other barrel (and missed),
it fled away with the speed of the wind,
followed by the swift and powerful hound,
which, quick as thought, Angus let slip,
and both vanished down a deep glen,
overhung by silver birches, close by.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Ohone a Dhia!</i> but he has missed it,
after all&mdash;it is no use guiding a Sassenach
whateffer!' muttered Angus, under his
thick, ruddy moustache; yet, as Cameron
could read by the expression that
twinkled in his hazel eyes, secretly not
ill-pleased at the result, however.
</p>

<p>
'I almost did it&mdash;hit him, at all events!'
said Holcroft, with intense mortification,
as he was too much of an Englishman not
to wish to excel in everything that
appertained to sport.
</p>

<p>
'Almost!' repeated Angus, who added
to Cameron, in a low voice, "<i>Cha d'rinse
theob riomh sealg!</i>" (<i>i.e.</i>, Almost, never
killed the game).
</p>

<p>
'Better luck next time,' said the young
Laird of Stratherroch, consolingly.  'Allan
has knocked over his deer, I see.'
</p>

<p>
'Attempt and Did-not were the two
worst hounds of Fingal,' muttered Angus,
in his Perthshire Gaelic, with a furtive
glance, fall of meaning, at Stratherroch.
</p>

<p>
'To the genuine Highlander,' says a
recent English writer, 'it is a fixed article
of belief that there never yet was a
Sassenach who knew more about the wind and
weather, or about the innumerable other
mysteries which furnish the stalker with
the tact and skill required to perfect him
in his difficult craft, than a cow
understands of conic sections.  With true Celtic
caution and prudence, the gillies tolerate
the opulent tenant from the south out of
respect for his cheque-book and his
frequent drafts upon it; but in their hearts
they look upon him as an <i>intruder</i>, and are
not sorry when they contemplate his
receding form, as he turns his face
homewards, and leaves moor, loch, and mountain,
glen and forest to 'their natural denizens.'
</p>

<p>
And in this spirit Angus was secretly
regarding the unconscious Mr. Holcroft,
who had the genuine Southern idea that
no man of woman born could undervalue
him.
</p>

<p>
So the little shooting-party united now,
and, not unwillingly, all sat down to have
luncheon, as they were sharply appetised
by long exercise in the keen mountain air,
and on no other tablecloth than the purple
heather; the ample contents of a hamper&mdash;game
pies, cold beef, bread, champagne
(cooled in an adjacent runnel), whisky,
and so forth&mdash;were laid out by the active
hands of the gillies, expectant of their
own repast when the time came.
</p>

<p>
They lunched near the mossy ruins of a
clachan&mdash;some of those melancholy ruins
so common over all the Highlands, the
traces of a departed people who have
passed away to other lands, evicted by
grasping selfishness to make way for
grouse and deer.
</p>

<p>
There, the low, shattered gables, an old
well, some gooseberry bushes that marked
'where a garden had been,' were all that
remained of a once populous village,
whose men had often gone forth to fight
for Scotland in the wars of old, and whose
descendants in latter years had manned
more than one company of the Black
Watch in Egypt and the Peninsula.
</p>

<p>
On the sunny hill-slope close by, a ruined
wall, low and circular&mdash;above which appeared
the grey arms of a solitary Celtic cross,
an aged yew-tree, and where long grass
waved in the wind&mdash;marked where lay the
last of the clan, whom no human power
could evict or send towards the setting
sun; and these imparted a melancholy to
the solemn scenery, for solemn it was with
all its beauty.
</p>

<p>
It was of that kind peculiar to some
parts of Perthshire, where the subordinate
hills, rising a thousand feet and more
above the valley, are entirely covered with
dusky pines, taking away all that appearance
of blackness and desolation presented
by naked mountain masses, and adding
softness and beauty to the landscape, which
would otherwise be stern and grim.  Nor
were the glassy loch and the murmuring
torrent wanting there, nor those passes
where the mountains approach each other,
and make them, like that of Killiecrankie,
excel even the famous Vale of Tempe.
</p>

<p>
Though not very impressionable by
Nature, Holcroft, influenced by the good
things he was imbibing, said something
about the beauty of the scenery, to which
Lord Aberfeldie responded, adding, with a
laugh,
</p>

<p>
'I do enjoy life in a shooting-box, and
of all the entrancing sports to me there is
none like stalking the deer.'
</p>

<p>
With his sodden knickerbocker suit
drying slowly upon him in the mountain
wind, Holcroft could only assent to this
faintly, and wished, perhaps, that, like
Stratherroch, he wore a kilt, and could
wring the water out of the plaits thereof.
</p>

<p>
'Of old in Scotland,' resumed Lord
Aberfeldie, as he lit his briar-root pipe,
'no man was deemed perfect in the craft
of hunting till he had landed a salmon
from the pool, shot an eagle on the wing,
and killed a stag.  But, when here in a
shooting-box, I always thank heaven that
I am at least fifteen miles from a telegraph
wire, that letters can only come once a
day, and just before dinner, and bills and
lawyers' letters seldom or never at all.
Have a glass of something before you
lunch, Dugald,' he said, addressing his
venerable keeper; 'I know you will prefer
Glenlivet to all the Clicquot and Moet in
the world.'
</p>

<p>
'A cless, thank you kindly, my lord,'
replied Dugald, touching his bonnet,
'though my mouth can hold more of
whateffer it be.'
</p>

<p>
And, bowing to the company, Dugald
drained it in quick time.
</p>

<p>
'I daresay, Holcroft,' said Allan, 'you
would prefer the deer driven to being
stalked?'
</p>

<p>
'Infinitely!' replied the other, as he
quaffed a bumper of sparkling Moselle.
</p>

<p>
'Well, I for one do not,' said the Master,
emphatically.
</p>

<p>
'The Highlander of old would follow a
stag for days, or even for weeks, if
necessary,' observed Lord Aberfeldie, with
kindling eyes, 'sleeping in his plaid among
the heather, he would lie where night
found him.  With his long gaff he would
catch a salmon between the water and the
sky; but when stalking he had no
conception of the brutal German battues now so
common in the Highlands, and so degrading
to sport,' he added; in his energy,
forgetting that there was something of
rebuke in his remarks, which certainly made
Holcroft's cheek redden with annoyance,
and his rather shifty eyes to lower.
</p>

<p>
The Master, aware that this subject was
rather a hobby with his father, hastened
to change the conversation by observing,
</p>

<p>
'How strange it seems, Stratherroch,
that you and I should be so suddenly here
after all these past years with the
regiment&mdash;here among the purple heather and
green bracken again.'
</p>

<p>
'And a few weeks hence will see us
with it again, and back to the old
pipe-clay routine,' said Cameron.
</p>

<p>
'Regiments are now no longer what
they were in my time,' said Lord Aberfeldie,
a little irrelevantly, perhaps, but
pursuing his own ideas.  'Examinations,
cramming and useless pedantry, promotion
by selection and compulsory retirement
for the officers, with short service among
the men, render corps no longer what they
were in the old days, each a happy,
movable home.  The time when a young
officer often said, with just pride and
noble ambition, "My father and my
grandfather have both commanded <i>this</i> regiment,
and, please God, I hope at some period to
do the same," can never come again!  And
what Highland officer now, in the Black
Watch or any other of our national regiments,
is followed to the colours by a band
of his own name and kindred, or can
speak of his comrades as "my father's
people," or "the men from our glen;"
and yet such was the case when yonder
ruined clachan was instinct with village
life, and the voices of children were heard
around its humble hearths.'
</p>

<p>
'The hero of Ghuznee had a theory that
no Scotsman was fitted to command a
regiment,' said Stratherroch, laughing.
</p>

<p>
'I know that he detested Scotsmen, and
brought six officers, all Scotsmen, to a
court-martial; and it was then he is said
to have made the statement which cost
him so dear in India.'
</p>

<p>
'How?' asked Holcroft.
</p>

<p>
'Because, within an hour after, old
Colonel Wemyss, of the 52nd, paraded
him in rear of the cantonment, and planted
a bullet in his body by way of curing him
of prejudice for the future.  Rather a
convincing argument, old Wemyss thought
it,' added Aberfeldie, laughing, as he
knocked the ashes from his cherished briar-root,
put it in its case, and dropped it into his
silver-mounted sporran.
</p>

<p>
'Talking of regiments, I saw yours at
Portsmouth, Graham,' said Holcroft; 'and
I thought the men looked graceful indeed,
with their kilts over their left shoulders
and their black sporrans waving above
their bronzed faces.'
</p>

<p>
Whether this was meant as a joke or a
sneer, it is impossible to say; but his
hearers took it as the former, and laughed
accordingly, on which Holcroft added,
</p>

<p>
'I mean their plaid-shawls over their
shoulders.  I remember that Miss
Raymond laughed heartily when I made the
same remark.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't wonder at that,' said Lord
Aberfeldie.  'Olive is a girl who laughs on
very slight occasions.'
</p>

<p>
'You have not seen her since your
return,' said Holcroft to Allan Graham.
</p>

<p>
'No; but I shall very soon now.'
</p>

<p>
'She is a very handsome girl; what the
deuce have the men been about to leave
her all this time Miss Raymond?'
</p>

<p>
'All this time?  Why, she has not yet
seen her twentieth year,' exclaimed Allan,
with some annoyance, as he thought of the
photo.
</p>

<p>
'Her costumes are <i>chic</i>,' continued
Holcroft, '<i>chic</i> to a degree!  How I admired
her portrait in the Grosvenor Gallery; and
wise was the artist to label it "Fair to
See."'
</p>

<p>
Allan glanced at his father, and his face
clouded to hear all this&mdash;praise though it
was&mdash;in the mouth of Hawke Holcroft.
</p>

<p>
'You have an appreciation of beauty,
apparently,' said young Cameron.
</p>

<p>
'Who has not?  Thus, as Disraeli says,
"the action of lovely woman on our
destiny is increasing," and, as Miss
Raymond&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I am Miss Raymond's uncle and guardian,'
said Lord Aberfeldie, rather stiffly,
and to Mr. Holcroft, as it seemed, a little
irrelevantly, though cutting short
whatever he meant to say; for the peer winced
at the way in which his guest referred to
his niece in the hearing of gillies and
gamekeepers, and, more than all, in the
presence of Allan, whose dark eyes wore
rather a lowering expression; but, as all
had hearty appetites after their recent
exercise and long exposure in the keen,
bracing mountain air of an autumn day,
they were inclined to use their knives and
forks rather than their tongues, and the
subject, however pleasing to Mr. Holcroft,
was dropped.
</p>

<p>
The latter was not a pleasing type of
Englishman, though his air and bearing
were thoroughly those of a gentleman.
He had a good square figure, but his legs
were somewhat of the spindle order, as
his knickerbocker suit revealed.  He was
flaxen-haired, fair-skinned, and somewhat
freckled, with a tawny moustache and
pale grey eyes; and strange it was that
these, though weak-looking, cunning, and
shifty, would assume at times, but covertly,
a defiant, even ferocious expression, if
evil passions excited him.
</p>

<p>
He was almost destitute of eyebrows,
but had a massive chin; and as Allan
Graham regarded him, as he lay stretched
upon the grass leisurely smoking, he by no
means showed his father's sentiment of
friendship for this son of an old friend;
and there grew in his breast a mysterious
instinct&mdash;almost a presentiment&mdash;that
Holcroft would in some way or other bring
trouble upon them conjunctly or severally.
</p>

<p>
After the keepers and gillies had their
repast, the luncheon apparatus was packed
up, and, shouldering their rifles, the
party set out for the shooting-box, which
was situated in a pretty glen a few miles
distant.
</p>

<p>
Angus, who was&mdash;as his father boasted&mdash;strong
as Cuchullin, again lifted the
deer to the pony's back, and preceded by
the family piper, Ronald Gair, with his
pipes in full blast to the air of 'The
Birks of Aberfeldie,' they departed down
the winding path towards the dark blue
loch that lay at the foot of the solemn,
pine-clad hills.
</p>

<p>
Like the gillies and keepers, Ronald
was never seen without a sprig of the
<i>Buaidh craob na Laibhreis</i> (the laurel-tree
of victory), the badge of the Grahams, in
his bonnet.
</p>

<p>
Ronald Gair's locks were silver now,
but they had been dark enough when he
played the Black Watch up the green slopes
of the Alma, through all Central India, to
the gates of Lucknow, and in later times
to the corpse-encumbered swamps of
Coomassie.
</p>

<p>
Holcroft winced at what he deemed the
dissonance of the pipes, and cursed their
sound in his heart; but he was too
well-bred or too prudent to say anything on
the subject as he strode by Cameron's
side down the strath, with a huge regalia
between his teeth.  Indeed, he might have
been pretty well used to their sound by
this time, as Ronald Gair roused the
household with them in the morning, preceded
many a meal&mdash;dinner always&mdash;and seemed
to spend most of his time in incessant
'tuning up' between.
</p>

<p>
'I have a suspicion that he is bad form,
this Holcroft,' said Allan to his father, as
they could converse, unheard by the other
two, amid the din of the pipes, which Ronald
blew as if to wake the Seven Sleepers of
Ephesus, or Holgar Danske in his cavern
at Elsinore.  'I have heard that he half
lives on play and his betting-book, and that
his little place in Essex, or rather what
remains of it, is dipped over head and ears.
Indeed, he admitted jocularly to Cameron
that it was mortgaged for thrice its value,
three times over, a fact which would
teach the holders prudence for the future.
Why did you have him here or at Dundargue?'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;his father and I were old
friends, as you know; his father, in fact,
by an act of great bravery, saved my life
at the Alma, when three Russians were at
the point of bayoneting me, as I lay helpless
on the field; so you see, Allan, I cannot
help being at least hospitable to the
poor fellow, and certainly his friend.'
</p>

<p>
Indeed, Lord Aberfeldie had always been
the latter to Holcroft, and not seldom his
'banker,' but of this Allan knew nothing,
nor was ever likely to know, so far as his
father was concerned.
</p>

<p>
'He seems to consider Olive an heiress,'
said Allan, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
'As&mdash;of course&mdash;she is.'
</p>

<p>
'And he dared to speak of her under
the slangy name of "cash" to Stratherroch,
as I, by chance, overheard.'
</p>

<p>
Lord Aberfeldie knitted his dark brows,
and said,
</p>

<p>
'I detest slang&mdash;it is deuced bad form;
but Holcroft belongs, I know, to a horsey
set.'
</p>

<p>
The sun was setting now, and gradually
his crimson glory was paling in fire on the
hill tops, till it faded out and died away,
and the shadows of the September night
crept upward step by step from the
deep glens below, and one by one the stars
came out above the trees&mdash;a sea of dark
and solemn pines that covered all the
mountain slopes&mdash;and ere long the red
lights from the curtained windows of the
luxurious shooting-lodge were seen to cast
long lines of wavering radiance across the
bosom of the loch, by the margin of which
it stood.
</p>

<p>
Ere this, the great greyhound Shiuloch
(whose name means speed) had returned,
drenched with water (showing that he had
pursued the stag into some distant loch)
and bloody with more than one wound
inflicted by antlers.
</p>

<p>
The sharp-set hunters had dined luxuriously,
and cigars with brandy and soda
had become the order of the night, when
the Master said to his father,
</p>

<p>
'I think I have had enough of
deer-stalking&mdash;three weeks nearly&mdash;and
to-morrow I shall start for Dundargue.'
</p>

<p>
'I think you are wise to do so,' replied
Lord Aberfeldie, with a pointed glance.
</p>

<p>
'Sorry to lose you, Graham,' said Holcroft,
concealing under a bright smile his
secret annoyance, envy, and alarm, of all
which more anon.
</p>

<p>
In this sudden resolution Allan Graham
was influenced, perhaps, by some remarks
of his father, the viscount, and pique at
those of Hawke Holcroft, together with a
natural longing to see his mother and
sister, and a growing consciousness that he
had been somewhat remiss and, to say the
least of it, ungallant to his cousin.  Thus,
next day, he took his departure for Dundargue;
but he could little foresee all the
bitter complications that were to arise, and
to culminate in the future, through his
merely lingering to stalk deer in his father's
forest.
</p>

<p>
When he went off, none shook his hand
more warmly than Hawke Holcroft, though
the latter muttered under his breath,
</p>

<p>
'Fool that I was, not to make my
innings before this fellow came; but if
some people could be put out of the way,
that others might take their place, how
much pleasanter this world would be&mdash;to
other people, at least.'
</p>

<p>
Little did the family of Aberfeldie know
that in Hawke Holcroft they had among
them an unscrupulous adventurer and most
dangerous guest!

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
UNCLE RAYMOND'S WILL.
</h3>

<p>
'Marriage, indeed!' exclaimed Olive Raymond,
'it will be time enough to speak of
that when this "laggard in love," your
brother, turns up here at Dundargue.
Besides, all women don't marry, so why
should I?'
</p>

<p>
'Most pretty ones do, and marry you
must!' replied, with a merry little laugh,
Eveline Graham, the sole daughter of the
house of Aberfeldie, to her English cousin,
as she usually called her.
</p>

<p>
'Such stuff all this is!  Does not the
author of "The Red Rag" say that "if
there is a circumstance calculated to breed
mutual detestation in the minds of two
young people, it is the knowledge that
their respective parents have destined them
for each other!"'
</p>

<p>
'How readily you quote,' said Eveline.
</p>

<p>
'Because I have the subject at heart.'
</p>

<p>
They were posed like a couple of Du
Maurier's fashionable girls, and were
leisurely sipping afternoon tea at a pretty
Chippendale table from an exquisite
Wedgwood service, and, for freedom to
gossip, had dispensed with all attendance.
</p>

<p>
Both the cousins were handsome girls,
whose bearded, belted, and corsletted
ancestors&mdash;portraits of whom hung on the
walls, and who had often
</p>

<p>
  'Carved at the meal with gloves of steel,'<br />
</p>

<p>
in that same Castle of Dundargue&mdash;would
have regarded such a repast and such a
beverage as 'afternoon tea' with no small
wonder, and, perhaps, disgust.
</p>

<p>
Eveline Graham was very softly featured
and slender in figure; but Olive Raymond,
who was the taller of the two, was
more fully developed, yet looked slim as a
Greek goddess in a dress of deep blue that
became her pure complexion and rich
brown hair, with only a tiny bouquet of
white flowers in the brooch at her bosom,
and a multitude of silver bangles&mdash;emblems
of conquest, perhaps&mdash;like silver fetters,
on her slender and snowy wrists.  She
was fair and colourless, with dark grey
violet eyes that looked black under their
jetty fringes at night.
</p>

<p>
Eveline was more dazzlingly fair, but
more <i>petite</i>, with soft, hazel eyes, and
bright, brown hair that was shot with
gold.  She had exquisite hands and feet,
and though <i>petite</i>, as we say, and slender,
she had a peculiar grace and dignity of
manner that only required a brocade-dress,
ruff, and long stomacher to make her like
one of her stately 'forbears,' whose
portraits by Jameson were in the room in
which she sat&mdash;a modern portion of the
grim old Castle of Dundargue, the aspect
and construction of which edifice were
very different from those of the additions
that had been made to it in later times.
</p>

<p>
And as the girls sit there, in the tempered
light of the afternoon sun streaming
through the French windows that open to
a stately balustraded terrace, and sip their
tea leisurely, their conversation will throw
some light upon the past, and perhaps the
future, of certain of our <i>dramatis personæ</i>.
</p>

<p>
'When Allan returns&mdash;'began Eveline.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, don't talk to me again of Allan!'
interrupted Olive Raymond, with a
petulant toss of her pretty head, 'or I will
begin to tease you about Stratherroch.'
</p>

<p>
'How?' asked Eveline, colouring perceptibly.
</p>

<p>
'He loves you&mdash;and you know he does.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' said Eveline, as a soft smile stole
over her mignonne face; 'I cannot doubt
it, though no word from which I could
infer it has ever escaped his lips; but
poor Cameron has little more than his pay.
His paternal acres are mortgaged to the
full&mdash;even the shootings and fishings,
believe, don't come to him.  I heard
papa express to mamma his surprise that
Cameron could "pull through," as he
phrased it; that he would have no
ineligibles in future dangling about me,
and that&mdash;as I have nothing&mdash;I must
marry <i>money</i>!  That was the word&mdash;oh,
how selfish it sounds, and how hateful!'
added the girl, while her rosy little nether
lip quivered.  'Poor Evan!' she
murmured, dreamily; and as she uttered his
name her voice, which was soft even as
Cordelia's, became like that of Annie
Laurie, 'low and sweet.'
</p>

<p>
'Ineligibles!' said her cousin; 'and yet
he invited here Mr. Holcroft, who is
well-nigh penniless, and against whose
attentions Aunt Aberfeldie specially warned
me.'
</p>

<p>
'In the interests of Allan, of course.'
</p>

<p>
'Allan&mdash;absurd!' exclaimed Olive,
shrugging her handsome shoulders.  'You all
seem to forget that he can only remember
me as a little girl.'
</p>

<p>
'Still you are his <i>fiancée</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'In a manner of way.'
</p>

<p>
'Distinctly so, if the tenor of your papa's
will is to be observed.'
</p>

<p>
'Then I think he might have had some
curiosity about me, instead of spending
days at that stupid deer-forest.  For all
he knows, I might have been a veritable
fright!' added Olive, with growing pique,
as she glanced at the reflection of her own
beautiful self in an adjacent console-mirror.
'If he thinks that, as Master of Aberfeldie,
he has only to come and see, and
conquer, I shall teach him that he is very
much mistaken.'
</p>

<p>
'Olive&mdash;how can you talk thus?'
expostulated soft little Eveline; 'his delay
is probably all papa's fault.'
</p>

<p>
'I am sure that I shall hate him then!'
</p>

<p>
'Query?' said Eveline, with a saucy
smile on her lovely lips.
</p>

<p>
'There is no query in this case,' persisted
Olive, as she set down her cup with
a jerk; for in her spirit of freedom there
was at times a curious but unexpressed
antagonism in her heart to the family of
Aberfeldie, as if she felt herself somewhat
in their power, and even to her own
disadvantage, and this spirit, which Holcroft
was not slow to discover, had rather
encouraged his hopes.
</p>

<p>
'He will be sure to love you, at all
events, Olive dear, if he has any sense or
power of observation at all&mdash;you are so
pretty&mdash;nay, so charming.'
</p>

<p>
'Any fool may love a pretty face, and
generally does so.'
</p>

<p>
'But you possess much more than a
pretty face, Olive.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;the fortune which I am to
share with him ere my twenty-fifth year.'
</p>

<p>
'Or, if you refuse&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'One half of it goes to him, and the
other, or nearly so, to charitable
institutions,' exclaimed Olive, her sweet face
paling with absolute anger.
</p>

<p>
'He will love you for yourself alone, I
am assured,' persisted Eveline, in defence
of her brother.  'You are beautiful, Cousin
Olive; you ride, row, dance, play lawn-tennis,
and flirt to perfection.  Are not all
these qualities calculated to excite
admiration in a young officer; and then, more
than all, you have such dear, funny ways
with you.'  And the warm-hearted girl
concluded by laughing and kissing her cousin
on both cheeks effusively.
</p>

<p>
The tenor of this remarkable will,
which has been referred to more than
once, was, to say the least of it, peculiar.
</p>

<p>
Some years before this period, Olive
Raymond arrived at Dundargue an orphan,
left in charge of Lord Aberfeldie&mdash;the
child of his only sister, Muriel Graham,
who had married a Mr. Raymond, a poor
man, whom means furnished by the Aberfeldie
family enabled to become one of the
wealthiest planters in Jamaica.  Both her
parents had died early, and after her
location at Dundargue she became a species of
sister to Eveline and Allan Graham.
</p>

<p>
Happy, indeed, was Olive alike in her
Scottish home in the lovely Carse of
Gowrie, and when the family took up their
abode, according to the season or the
sitting of Parliament, at their West-end
residence in London.
</p>

<p>
By will, Mr. Oliver Raymond left his
entire fortune, which was very
considerable, to his daughter; but, in gratitude to
the family of his wife, on the strange
condition that she was to marry his nephew,
Allan Graham, whose death alone was to
free her from that contingency.  If she
unreasonably refused, then, in that case,
after her twenty-fifth year, she was to
forfeit all that would accrue to her, save a
very slender allowance&mdash;the share so
forfeited to become the inheritance of her
cousin Allan; and if <i>he</i> declined to wed his
cousin Olive, then, in <i>that</i> case, the money
so forfeited was to go to such Scottish
charitable institutions as Lord Aberfeldie
and the other trustees might select.
</p>

<p>
This will was, undoubtedly, a strange
one; but then Mr. Raymond had been a
strange and eccentric man, animated by
an intense regard and esteem for the
family of his deceased wife, the Grahams
of Aberfeldie, to whom he felt all his good
fortune had been due.
</p>

<p>
As children, the tenor of this tyrannical
will in no way affected the relations of
Olive and Allan with each other; and the
latter&mdash;a manly and sturdy lad, when at
home from the College of Glenalmond,
where he pursued his studies and cultivated
cricket, boxing, and football&mdash;petted
and made much of the violet-eyed and
brown-haired little cousin, who had dropped
among them as if from the clouds; but
after he had joined the Black Watch as a
subaltern, and years passed on, and they
began to be talked of and deemed in the
family circle as an engaged couple,
betrothed, affianced, and all the rest of it,
the young beauty and heiress began to
resent the terms of the will bitterly,
perhaps not unreasonably; she became, as we
have said, antagonistic, and was perplexed
to think that her father could not have
foreseen some difficulties on the part of
his two legatees.
</p>

<p>
Thus, as they both grew older, she
seldom replied to the letters which Allan
wrote to her, by his parents' desire,
perhaps, rather than his own, till he ceased to
write to her at all, on which she became
severely piqued; and once when she was
a little way on in her 'teens,' and when
Allan was at home for a very brief period
before departing to India, she treated
him with an indifference&mdash;almost
animosity&mdash;that made him deem the girl wayward,
cold-hearted, even purse-proud, and
everything unpleasant; and with this fatal
impression he rejoined the Black Watch, and
amid many a flirtation might soon have
forgotten the heiress that was growing up
for him at Dundargue, but for the letters
he received from thence, and in which
ample references to her and her beauty
and accomplishments were never omitted;
while she, on the other hand, when she
became of a marriageable age, seldom
ceased to stigmatise the will as outrageous,
indelicate, grotesque, and unjust.
And now that her cousin Allan was coming
home&mdash;nay, <i>had</i> come home&mdash;for a protracted
period on leave of absence, she felt
that a crisis was at hand in her fate&mdash;a
crisis in which she, like a hunted creature,
knew not how to escape.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Allan will soon learn to love you
for your own sake,' returned the gentle
Eveline, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
'How can I ever be certain of that?
Oh, I owe little indeed to papa, who by
such a will as his seeks to degrade both
your brother and myself,' replied Olive.
</p>

<p>
'Degrade!' exclaimed Eveline, her hazel
eyes distending.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;by forcing us into a marriage on
one hand, or to accepting starvation on the
other.'
</p>

<p>
'Starvation!&mdash;such strong language,
Olive,' said Eveline, in a tone of rebuke.
</p>

<p>
Of the alleged tie that bound her to
Allan Graham, and of the latter himself,
personally, she had never thought so
seriously as she had done of <i>late</i>; and, truth
to tell, in the opportunities afforded by
mutual residence in a country house&mdash;that
great rambling castle especially&mdash;Mr. Hawke
Holcroft, by his subtle attentions
when no one else was near, had begun to
interest her more than Lord or Lady
Aberfeldie could have relished or conceived;
and to her it seemed that for some time
back at Dundargue (continuing a
sentiment he had striven to rouse during a
past season in London) his eyes bad been
telling in imploring and passionate glances
what his lips had not yet the audacity to
utter; but then the girl was young,
enthusiastic, impressionable, and far from
insensible to admiration and flattery.
</p>

<p>
Though she did not and could not regard
Allan Graham as a lover, and disliked
thus to view him in the light of her
intended husband, circumstances now
compelled her to <i>think</i> of him; and though she
remembered him chiefly as the playmate
of her childhood, she was piqued that he
seemed in no haste to meet and see her,
but instead had openly manifested, as she
thought, indifference and lack of interest
or curiosity, by shooting at Aberfeldie Lodge
for days.
</p>

<p>
Thus pique made her not indisposed to
encourage the attention of others,
especially of Hawke Holcroft, as we shall show,
when he returned to Dundargue before his
departure for London.
</p>

<p>
Olive Raymond in her pride of heart
bitterly resented the tenor of her father's
will.  She knew that by the chances of
war, climate, and foreign service generally,
she might never have seen her cousin
again; but now the inevitable seemed at
hand, and she felt herself in a measure
set apart for him as fairly as if she had
personally betrothed herself; but was she
to be bound, while he was absolutely free?
And stories she had heard&mdash;some of them
artfully and casually dropped by Holcroft&mdash;of
more than one flirtation at Chatham
and elsewhere, added to the pique in which
she was indulging.
</p>

<p>
Lady Aberfeldie now came in through
one of the open French windows for her
cup of afternoon tea, with a bright scarlet
shawl loosely floating over her handsome
head and shapely shoulders, quitting the
terrace, where she had been amusing
herself by feeding the peacocks.
</p>

<p>
She was looking unusually radiant as
she announced that Angus, the young
keeper, had just come from the shooting
lodge to inform her that the Master would
be home that afternoon, and that his
rooms must be put in order for him
without delay.
</p>

<p>
So, on hearing this, the wilful Olive
resolved to pay a protracted visit elsewhere,
and to be absent when he did arrive.
</p>

<p>
No woman understood the art of dressing
better than Lady Aberfeldie, and well
was she aware how truly a dainty maize or
a coral colour with rich black lace
trimmings became her brunette tints, her dark
hair and eyes, her pure, yet slightly olive
complexion.  Her whole air was graceful
and queenly, as befitted one who was
always to 'walk in silk attire.'
</p>

<p>
Lady Aberfeldie never forgot that she
had been the belle of three seasons in
Belgravia, and an heiress to the boot, though
the memories of others might be less
retentive; and now, in her fortieth year,
she was a very handsome blooming woman
still.
</p>

<p>
'We must have some dinners and no
end of dances and lawn-tennis parties,
mamma, in honour of Allan's return,' said
Eveline, as she assisted her mother to
tea.
</p>

<p>
'Thank God, my dear boy is home&mdash;home
again&mdash;and safe at last&mdash;after all he
has faced and undergone,' said Lady
Aberfeldie, with a bright and fond expression
in her fine face.  'Why, it seems but
yesterday, Olive, that you and he were little
chits playing together on the lawn or at
Nannie's knee&mdash;when you had rag dolls,
and used to sing together of the old
woman that lived in a shoe, or "High upon
Highlands and low upon Tay," or of
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Alexander, King of Macedon,<br />
  Who conquered the world but Scotland alone;<br />
  When he came to Scotland his courage grew cold,<br />
  To find a little nation courageous and bold,<br />
  So stout and so bold&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
You remember the nursery song, Olive?'
</p>

<p>
'I have forgotten it, aunt.'
</p>

<p>
'Then I hope you will remember in its
place the adage&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What adage?' interrupted Olive sharply.
</p>

<p>
'That a good son makes a good husband,'
said Lady Aberfeldie, archly, and
laughing as she tapped her niece's soft
cheek with her teaspoon.
</p>

<p>
'Adages are not to my taste, aunt.'
</p>

<p>
'Child, what makes you seem so cross
to-day?'
</p>

<p>
'The weather, perhaps,' suggested Eveline.
</p>

<p>
But Olive, who had rather a mutinous
expression in her soft face, remained
silent.
</p>

<p>
'This is bad form in our day of joy,'
said Lady Aberfeldie, who had been eyeing
her closely.  'In society well-bred people
always control their emotions&mdash;their feelings.'
</p>

<p>
'Easy enough for them, aunt.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'Because they have seldom any feelings
to control.'
</p>

<p>
And to prevent more being said with
reference to Allan&mdash;a subject she
dreaded&mdash;Olive Raymond withdrew.

CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
THE GRAHAMS OF DUNDARGUE.
</h3>

<p>
Who would have imagined that within a
few yards of the elegant and stately
modern drawing-room in which these three
handsome women of the best style were
chatting and sipping their tea, there still
existed within the old walls of Dundargue
a hideous oubliette or bottle dungeon, like
those that were in the Castle of St. Andrews
and ancient peel of Linlithgow&mdash;so
named from the French word to 'forget.'
</p>

<p>
Shaped like a bottle, it was&mdash;and
is&mdash;totally dark and of great depth, with no
outlet but its narrow mouth, through
which prisoners were precipitated and left
to die.  'Dante,' says Victor Hugo, when
describing that in the Bastille, 'could find
nothing better for the construction of his
hell.  These dungeon-funnels usually
terminated in a deep hole like a tub, in
which Dante has placed his Satan, and in
which society placed the criminal
condemned to death.  When once a miserable
human being was interred there&mdash;farewell
light, air, life, and hope!  It never went
out but to the gibbet or the stake.
Sometimes it was left to rot there, and human
justice called that forgetting.  Between
mankind and himself the condemned felt
an accumulation of stones and jailers,
and the whole prison was but one
enormous and complicated lock that barred
him out of the living world.'
</p>

<p>
From such places the shrieks and wails
of despair and death&mdash;death from thirst
and hunger&mdash;never reach the upper air.
</p>

<p>
When the oubliette of Dundargue was
examined a few years ago there was found
in it a mass of unctuous-looking mould
that made those shudder who looked upon
it.  It was full of skulls and human bones.
Of whom those beings had been even
tradition was silent; but, as some coins
of Edward I. of England were found
among the ghastly remains, they were
supposed to have been certain English
prisoners or fugitives, who, when flying
from the siege of Perth, had fallen into
the hands of Sir Malise Graham of
Dundargue, in the Carse of Gowrie, a
relentless enemy of the invaders of his country,
who said, grimly, 'A few Englishmen less
in the world would make the world all the
better,' and, dropping them successively
into the oubliette, placed a huge stone
over the mouth of it, and 'forgot' all
about them.
</p>

<p>
From a short distance beyond Dundee,
called 'The Beautiful' in the days of old,
the lovely and fertile Carse of Gowrie, so
famed in Scottish song, stretches far
westward, bounded by the Firth of Tay on
the south, and a line of undulating hills
on the north, till it narrows to a vale
among the rocky eminences that overlook
the fair city of Perth.
</p>

<p>
The Carse is not quite a dead level,
for here and there slope up wooded or
cultivated elevations, named Inches,
serving to show that in the ages they won
their name the Carse had been a wide,
open lake; but above one of these inches
towers the abrupt, though not very lofty,
rock crowned by the Castle of Dundargue,
an edifice on which the surrounding hills
have looked down for centuries.
</p>

<p>
Bronze or iron rings, to which the
Romans are said to have moored their
galleys, were lately to be seen in the
rock of Dundargue, and cables have been
found at the foot of the Sidlaw Hills,
relics of the time when an inland sea
rolled its waves against their now grassy
slopes.
</p>

<p>
The original castle, or strong square
tower, starts flush from the edge of the
rock, out of which its oubliette and lower
vaults are hollowed, standing clear and
minute against the sky, and its machicolated
battlements rise high above the
more florid modern additions of the days
of James VI. and Queen Anne.
</p>

<p>
From its stone bartizan can be seen the
sweep of the broad, blue Firth of Tay,
with its vessels, the varied surface of the
beautiful Carse of Gowrie clothed with
leafy timber, narrow stripes of sand-edged
land, and long stretches of cultivated
ground, studded with curious old orchards
and ancient and hoary forests of dwarf
oak; and on the north and west the glorious
blue mountains, piled over each other
in ranges, and capped, afar off, by the
historic Grampians.
</p>

<p>
The earliest portion of the edifice is
said to have been built by Sir Malise
Graham, and possesses the battlemented
bartizan, which was a decided feature in the
architecture of Scotland long before her
intimate connection with the Continent;
and the tenures of many houses in the
vicinity are still held by owners who, if
they had to fulfil the original obligations,
would be compelled to bring to the castle
coal for its fires, beer and beef for its
tables, and oats for the chargers of the
men-at-arms, with cords to bind and hang
prisoners condemned to the dule-tree.
</p>

<p>
The Grahams, Viscounts of Aberfeldie
and Barons of Dundargue in the peerage
of Scotland, had the barony bestowed on
them in 1600, in consequence of the
bravery of the then laird at the battle
of Benrinnes, six years before, and the
viscounty in 1648, for doughty deeds done
in the wars of the Covenant; but they
had been lairds of Dundargue in days that
were remote indeed&mdash;the days of that
Graham who, when expiring of a mortal
wound on the field of Dunbar, gave his
sword&mdash;the same weapon now preserved
in the house of Montrose&mdash;to his son,
'the Graham' of future battles, 'the Richt
Hand of Wallace,' in whose arms he
expired of a wound, after the battle of
Falkirk, leaving the patronymic of 'gallant'
to all his descendants.
</p>

<p>
In one apartment hung with Gobelin
tapestry stood a bed wherein Charles II. had
reposed before his coronation at Scone;
and another had been occupied by his
nephew, James VIII., of the Scottish
Jacobites, before he went to visit Castle Lyon,
the guest of John, Lord Aberfeldie, who
declined to sit in the Union Parliament,
and who, to the end of his days, even when
George III. was king, was wont to assert
'that green peas and the other edibles
were always a month later, after that vile
and degrading incorporation,' and that
many a sweet flower never blossomed
again after the White Rose was destroyed
at Culloden.
</p>

<p>
In right of gift to an ancestor, the
present peer was Hereditary Keeper of
the Royal Palace of Falkland, and as such
wore a key and chain of silver at his neck
on collar days at Windsor and elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
It was a September afternoon&mdash;almost
evening&mdash;when the pastures had become
parched, the foliage shrivelled and of
various tints, and high-piled wains came
rocking over the furrowed fields and through
green lanes as the harvest was led home,
that a horseman 'might have been seen'
(to use the phraseology of Mr. G. P. R. James)&mdash;nay,
was seen&mdash;to ride leisurely
down the Carse and take a flying leap over
a hedge into the great lawn of Dundargue,
and then, after trotting his horse between
belts of trees, he drew his bridle for a few
minutes, while he lingered and regarded
fondly and admiringly the old structure,
which he had not seen for well-nigh seven
years; and Allan, the Master of Aberfeldie&mdash;for
he the rider was&mdash;thought there was
not in all the Carse of Gowrie another
residence to compare with Dundargue for
the many stories and characteristics that
circle about a house which has been for
ages the home of one family, with all its
historic memories, its traditions and patriotism.
</p>

<p>
The shadows of the great old trees
under which more than one Scottish king
had blown his hunting-horn fell far along
the turf, that was green as an emerald and
soft as velvet.  A semi-transparent haze,
mingling with the sunshine, pervaded the
Carse land; the smoke of an adjacent
village ascended from the hoary orchards
around it, and far eastward fell the shadow
of the tall and weather-worn keep of
Dundargue, with all its tourelles, or Scottish
turrets, tinted redly by the rays of the
setting sun; and Allan's heart swelled as
he looked around, for the love of his native
land was strong within him, and he
recalled the words of an English writer, who
describes it as the place chosen by Nature
as the mirror of her beauty:
</p>

<p>
'She has planted it in the northern seas,
with its mountains fronting the western
sun, and watered its plains and valleys
with a thousand streams, over which the
lights of heaven are poured with an
illumination and a glory, with an entanglement
and a mingling of all the colours that can
make earth beautiful.  There is no land
in all the world which, for the softer
splendours of mountain and fell, wood and
stream, surpasses Scotland!'
</p>

<p>
And Allan now remembered that the
green ridge on which he had reined up
his horse for a moment or two had been
to him a place of fear, when a child, as
the abode of the <i>Daoine Shi</i>&mdash;the goblins
or fairies&mdash;who could be heard at work in
the heart of the knoll, busily opening and
shutting great chests, the contents of
which were alleged to be the pillage of
pantries, larders, and meal-girnels; and
once an old housekeeper at Dundargue,
who contrived to circumvent them by
securing the door of her premises, was
struck with blindness, from which she did
not recover till the barrier was removed.
</p>

<p>
Allan saw a lady suddenly appear upon
a path close by that which led to the
avenue; and she proved to be no other
than Olive Raymond, who, intent on being
absent when he arrived, came thus upon
him face to face, yet neither knew the
other.
</p>

<p>
On her arm she bore a little basket, with
some presents for her poor pensioners.
The cordiality and kindness of Olive to
the poor and labouring people made the
periodical return of the household from
London and elsewhere more than a matter
for local rejoicing.  There were none about
Dundargue but loved her, as they also did
Eveline Graham, though the latter did
less among them; and the Scottish peasantry,
it must be borne in mind, unlike others
elsewhere, are usually too self-reliant and
full of proper pride to accept aid from
Dorcas, blanket, food, or coal societies.
</p>

<p>
Well mounted, Allan had substituted a
light-grey tweed suit, which well became
his dark complexion, for his shooting-kilt
and jacket, and as a sudden light or
conviction came upon him, aided by a memory
of the photo he had seen in Holcroft's
possession, he sprang from his horse when
the young lady drew near.
</p>

<p>
'I beg your pardon,' said he, as he
threw the bridle over his arm and lifted
his hat; 'I cannot be mistaken, changed
though you are&mdash;you are my cousin, Olive
Raymond?'
</p>

<p>
She blushed deeply, and said,
</p>

<p>
'And you&mdash;are Allan Graham!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Olive.  Oh! how good, how kind
of you to come and meet me,' he replied,
his heart beating lightly as he looked into
her beautiful face and deftly possessed
himself of her hands.
</p>

<p>
'Far from it,' she replied, seeking to
release herself, and now growing pale with
positive annoyance at his supposition.  'I
have some duties to do at the village.  I
hope you enjoyed your shooting excursion?'
she observed, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
'I did&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'So much so, indeed, that you were in
no haste to come home,' said she, laughing
to conceal her secret vexation at the
rencontre.
</p>

<p>
Allan found his intended wife all that he
could have wished, and more than he could
have imagined.  The little girl he had left,
had now expanded into a tall, proud, and
lovely one&mdash;lovelier than he had ever
dreamed of her being; and under her
pretty black velvet hat her grey-violet
eyes regarded him with a curious mixture
of shyness and confusion in their expression,
and&mdash;though he did not then detect it&mdash;resentment.
</p>

<p>
When he had last seen his 'little wife,'
as he was wont to call her <i>then</i>, she
was a madcap girl, with all her golden
hair flying far and wide from a pearly
neck and brow, rippling and unconfined.
Now her braided hair was of the richest
brown, and she was the belle of a London
season, and he could not help acknowledging
in his heart the many charms she
possessed, and suddenly becoming very
appreciative thereof.
</p>

<p>
'I hope Mr. Holcroft is enjoying his
sport among the hills?' said she, after
another pause.
</p>

<p>
'Never mind Holcroft,' replied Allan, a
little piqued by her manner; 'have you no
welcome for me, Olive?'
</p>

<p>
'Of course you are glad to be home
again,' said she, evasively.
</p>

<p>
'I have always loved dear old Dundargue,
even when I came home as a boy
from school, and now I shall love it more
than ever.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Can you ask me&mdash;when you are its
permanent inmate?'
</p>

<p>
'I may not be so always,' said she,
pointedly.  'Nothing lasts for ever; but
as we are cousins&mdash;' she was about to add
something, yet paused.
</p>

<p>
'And more than mere cousins can ever
be to each other.  You might at least give
me your hand, Olive,' said he, drawing
nearer to her as she looked up at him,
earnestly, shyly, and then, he began to think,
rather defiantly, with those wonderful
violet-grey eyes of hers.  She gave him
her right hand, and, though cased in a
tight glove, a soft and warm little hand it
felt; but he drew her towards him, and,
ere she could avert the act, was softly and
swiftly kissed by him.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Don't</i>,' she exclaimed, as she snatched
her fingers from his clasp.  'How dare
you?' she added, repelling him with both
hands outspread, and a laughing indignation
that was <i>not</i> all laughter; but he
looked at the sweet red lips as though he
longed to offend again.
</p>

<p>
'Olive, how can you treat me thus, after
all these years?' he asked, with an
emotion of annoyance.  'Have you forgotten
what jolly playmates we used to be; how
we went nutting and seeking birds' nests
together, made rag dolls, and chorused
"Alexander, King of Macedon," and so
forth, with our old nurse, Nannie
Mackinnon, the wife of Dugald Glas?'
</p>

<p>
'I have not forgotten; but I had
thought, or hoped, that you had done
so.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot say,' replied the wilful beauty,
pouting and yet confessing in her secret
heart how handsome he looked, and how
winning he was in eye and manner.
</p>

<p>
'I remember, too,' said he, laughingly,
'the scores of times we used to wander in
the garden, or on the heather braes,
seeking bees to <i>blob</i> and get the honey out of
them; and when on May mornings you
used to catch a snail by the horns, and
toss it over your left shoulder as an omen
of luck in marriage.'
</p>

<p>
'Allan, such odious and absurd things
should be forgotten.'
</p>

<p>
'We were children, then; and what
fun we had when fishing with tinnies in
the burn for minnows and pow-wowits
under the old brig-stone.  Do you remember
how I used to climb to get birds' nests
for you, and how we wove fairy caps of
rushes and bluebells in many a green howe
of the Sidlaw Hills?'
</p>

<p>
'How can you treasure such childish
memories, Allan?' she asked, but with
momentary softness in her manner.
</p>

<p>
'Because such were very dear to me
when far away in other lands and other
scenes, when the Indian sky was like a
sheet of heated iron overhead, and the
breeze that came from the sandy desert
was like the breath of the death-blast;
when cattle perished by the empty tanks,
the birds sat on the dusty trees with eyes
closed and beaks agape, and when strong
soldiers died on the line of march, stricken
down by sunstroke or sheer exhaustion.'
</p>

<p>
'Poor Allan!'
</p>

<p>
'And you are going to the village?'
said he, inquiringly, seeing that she
manifested no desire to return with
him.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'But won't you accompany me home,
now that I have returned?'
</p>

<p>
'You must excuse me&mdash;I do so
enjoy a walk in the evening before
dinner.'
</p>

<p>
'I have not seen my mother for seven
years,' he said, reproachfully; 'yet, if
you will permit me to accompany you to
the village, I shall do so, and then escort
you home.'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot trespass on your time so
much,' she replied, with a slight <i>soupçon</i>
of sarcasm in her tone; 'besides, what
would Aunt Aberfeldie think of your
being in no haste to see her, after
lingering so long at the deer-forest?'
</p>

<p>
Allan thought rightly that he now
detected the true source of her pique and
peculiar greeting; but he knew nothing
yet of her bitter opposition to the terms
of her father's will.
</p>

<p>
'Aunt and Eveline are anxiously waiting
you, so do not let me detain you longer.
If an escort back is requisite, I shall
doubtless find one with ease,' and, nodding her
head smilingly, she tripped down the
tree-shaded avenue and left him; thus he had
no choice, though looking after her with a
sigh, but to remount and ride towards the
house, or rather the castle, of Dundargue.
</p>

<p>
So&mdash;so she had so little interest in him,
in his return and his society&mdash;that she
would neither turn back with him nor
permit him to escort her, but had left him to
pay some trumpery visits which she could
do at any other time, day, or hour.
</p>

<p>
'How was this?' he asked of himself.
'Holcroft has certainly something to do
with it.  Why the deuce did my father
bring the fellow here?'
</p>

<p>
Allan's hitherto languid interest in her
had become quickened by the sight of her
undoubted beauty and grace, and he was,
perhaps, a little unreasonably piqued by
her open indifference as to his return from
remote foreign service, and to his views
and whole affairs.  Thus the breach
between these two&mdash;if such we may call
it&mdash;seemed likely to widen.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes more the affectionate
effusiveness of the welcome home accorded
him by his mother and his tender sister
consoled him, but it contrasted in his mind
powerfully and painfully with that of his
cousin; yet he could scarcely expect that
she would have flung her soft arms round
his neck and kissed him again and again
with hungry affection on both cheeks as
they did.
</p>

<p>
'The pater, dear old fellow, will be
home in the course of a day or two,' said
he.  'Mr. Holcroft is coming with him,
and Stratherroch, of Ours, too,' he added.
</p>

<p>
He noticed that Eveline's pale cheek
coloured for a moment at the name of the
latter.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, you know him, it seems?' said he.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, very well,' replied Eveline, frankly.
</p>

<p>
'He has been at home with the dépôt
lately.  A right good sort is Evan Cameron,
but desperately hard up, poor lad.  I often
think he will have to exchange for India
or something of that kind, though it would
break his heart to leave the Black Watch.'
</p>

<p>
Eveline's long lashes drooped as her
brother said this, all unconscious that his
casual remarks were secretly wounding
her.
</p>

<p>
The expression he could plainly detect
in the sweet and expressive face of his
sister at the mention of Evan Cameron
gave Allan some occasion for thought.
</p>

<p>
He loved and esteemed his friend and
brother-officer, but felt it would be a
serious misfortune indeed if any affection
took root between him and Eveline; for
Evan was poor, as we have hinted, his
estate valueless to him, and 'at nurse;'
and there was, moreover, a necessity for
Eveline making a wealthy marriage&mdash;indeed,
her father, Lord Aberfeldie, had
already a suitor in view for her.
</p>

<p>
'I am so sorry that our dear Olive is
out,' said Allan's mother, breaking a little
pause; 'but we knew not at what hour to
expect you.'
</p>

<p>
'I met her in the avenue&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'And you knew each other&mdash;how
strange!' exclaimed Lady Aberfeldie, with
a brightening face.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, after a minute or two.  She seems
as charming a girl as one&mdash;to use a
soldier's phrase&mdash;might see in the longest
day's march.'
</p>

<p>
'And such she is.  She did not turn
back with you?'
</p>

<p>
'No, mother,' he replied, with hesitation.
</p>

<p>
'But she was, of course, glad to see
you?'
</p>

<p>
'I can't say that she was particularly,
mater dear; and she got into a regular
pet because I dared to kiss her, even in a
cousinly way.'
</p>

<p>
'Dared, my darling boy!' exclaimed his
mother, indignantly.
</p>

<p>
'Fact, mater,' said the Master, smiling
and twirling up the ends of his long dark
moustaches.
</p>

<p>
Lady Aberfeldie and her daughter
exchanged a swift and mutual glance; but
the latter knew more of the views of the
young lady in question than the former did.
</p>

<p>
'I am glad you are pleased with Olive,'
said she; 'and when your acquaintance is
fully resumed you will find the dear girl all
you could wish.'
</p>

<p>
'She has wonderful blue-grey eyes; they
seem violet-blue when she smiles, and black
when she is angry.'
</p>

<p>
'Angry?' said Lady Aberfeldie, inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
'Well, she rather looked so when I
ventured to kiss her in the avenue,' said
Allan, laughing, and referring to a kiss
that, though snatched, he was never to
forget, perhaps, in the long years that
were to come.
</p>

<p>
'She has grown the very image of her
mother, your poor Aunt Muriel, who was
one of my bridesmaids.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
By visits to the minister's manse and
elsewhere Olive had wilfully and petulantly
contrived to protract her absence from
home to the last moment; the dressing-bell
had rung, and before dinner she was
hastily giving a few touches to her costume&mdash;not
that she cared to attract her cousin
(quite the reverse)&mdash;but she dismissed her
foreign maid, Clairette Patchouli, on a sign
that Eveline wished to talk with her alone.
</p>

<p>
'Now, Olive,' began the latter, 'that you
have seen Allan&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I saw him years ago,' interrupted Olive,
pettishly.
</p>

<p>
'He was a boy then; but now that he is
a man, and not the boy you remember,
what do you think of him?'
</p>

<p>
Olive made no reply, but continued to
slip her bangles on the whitest, roundest,
and most taper pair of arms that ever
bewildered the senses of man.
</p>

<p>
'Isn't he very handsome?' persisted
Eveline.
</p>

<p>
'To partial eyes, perhaps, but there are
plenty of men in the world quite as
handsome&mdash;even more so, I doubt not.  I like
him already, but don't let him think so;
besides, I also like our English visitor,
Mr. Holcroft.'
</p>

<p>
'I do <i>not</i>!' said Eveline, decisively.
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'He is horsey in bearing, and his face,
though handsome, I grant you, often wears
a sinister, sharp, and supercilious expression.'
</p>

<p>
'How tanned Allan is by the Indian
sun!'
</p>

<p>
'I think his face and head both grand
and handsome!' exclaimed his sister, with
affectionate enthusiasm; 'he quite reminds
me of the old Greeks.'
</p>

<p>
'I was not aware you knew any of them,'
laughed Olive.
</p>

<p>
'Their sculptures, I mean,' replied
Eveline, as they swept down the great
staircase to the dining-room.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
OLIVE AND ALLAN.
</h3>

<p>
A few days had now passed since Allan
Graham's return to Dundargue, but he
seemed&mdash;though greatly attracted by his
cousin Olive, and in a manner compelled to
think of her as something more than a
mere cousin&mdash;to make no progress in her
favour at all.  Sometimes he smoked beside
her in utter silence, while she swung in a
hammock between two trees on the lawn,
deep&mdash;or affecting to be so&mdash;in the last
three-volume novel that had come in the
box from Edinburgh; and, when they stole
furtive glances at each other, his were
curious and hers, under the shadow of
her gorgeous Japanese umbrella, were
hostile, defiant at least, and thus not
without a certain drollery; but few remarks
were interchanged of a more exciting
nature than that 'the weather was lovely,'
or 'the leaves were falling.'
</p>

<p>
In these days, and for long after, Olive
was terribly uncertain in her moods, and
to Allan Graham it seemed at times as if
she almost disliked him.
</p>

<p>
When they were alone together, which
was seldom, she scarcely spoke to him,
and thus his enforced silence disposed her
to be more silent still.  To Olive the whole
situation was one of miserable unrest; she
felt that there was something grotesque
in it, and she longed intensely to be
anywhere else than at Dundargue.
</p>

<p>
While Allan, admiring her rare beauty
and pretty, petulant ways, was already
learning to love her, he found his tongue
loaded, as it were, tied up, and his
tenderness cramped by the strange tenor of
her father's will, which made him feel that,
love her as he might, that love would never
seem pure, or without the taint of selfishness.
</p>

<p>
He had procured for her at Malta a
complete suite of gold and pearl-mounted
Maltese jewellery, the best that could be
found in the Strada San Paoli, costing
him more than even he could well afford;
but now so cold and repellant was her
demeanour that he had not the courage as
yet to present the elaborate trinkets&mdash;so
rich in fretwork and fine as a gossamer
web&mdash;so they were left to repose in their
purple velvet cases.
</p>

<p>
Yet his thoughts about her were
becoming persistent now.  Times there were
when he conceived that he would treat her
judiciously, but tenderly, and in such a
fashion that her feelings must slide into a
species of sisterly, or at least cousinly,
interest in him; but then&mdash;at these times&mdash;a
flash of her dark grey-blue eyes cast
these intentions to the winds, though
Allan began to feel nothing but passionate
love for her.
</p>

<p>
To him, as to her, the situation imparted
an awkwardness now, that of course he had
never been conscious of when a boy.  He
did not want the money of his cousin or of
anyone else, as he muttered to himself
while tugging and twisting his thick, dark
moustache; and thus, with all the
tenderness that was growing in his heart for
Olive, he often unconsciously adopted
towards her a studied courtesy and almost
indifferent bearing that somewhat galled
her ready pride, and made her think 'this
indifference to me, and the beauty all men
aver I possess, can only spring from a love
he bears some one else; and, with that
love in his heart, he seems actually ready
to conform to the outrageous wishes of
papa!'
</p>

<p>
And more convinced of this suspicion
did she become when she found that he
evinced no more desire to seek her society
than that of his mother or sister; but this
was the result of her own bearing.
</p>

<p>
Allan was ere long in sore perplexity.
The slightest attempt at tenderness she
repelled or seemed to shrink from, as a
sensitive plant shrinks from the touch;
and, on the other hand, the lack of it
seemed to increase her coldness and rouse
her sense of pride.
</p>

<p>
'What the deuce is the meaning of
this?' muttered Allan, as he chanced upon
a volume one day.  It was a very
handsome and expensive edition of some of
Byron's poems, which had been given by
Hawke Holcroft to Olive as a birthday
gift, and on turning over the leaves of
which he found innumerable paragraphs
and lines pencilled on pages that seemed
to fall naturally open, where these marks,
all of which referred to love and passion,
were most plentiful.
</p>

<p>
All of these seemed to have been selected
with an ulterior view for her perusal
and study.  Allan knit his brows and
tossed the volume to the other side of
the table.
</p>

<p>
'So, so,' thought he, 'Cousin Olive has
had a guide for her reading, and the guide
is that fellow Holcroft.  He has made
good use of his time, hang him!'
</p>

<p>
Olive, who had been watching him under
the deep fringes of her eyes, smiled when
she saw the action, and, instantly divining
the reason of it, resolved not to leave her
Byron lying about in future; and now a
new mood seized her.
</p>

<p>
'Tell me, Allan,' she said, suddenly
looking up from a piece of music she was
studying, 'did you ever think of me at
all when you were all these years far
away in India?'
</p>

<p>
'Have you forgotten what I told you on
the evening we met on the lawn?' said he,
reproachfully, yet surprised by her taking
the initiative in a conversation, especially
of this kind.  'Often, indeed, did I think
of you!'
</p>

<p>
'How&mdash;in what fashion?'
</p>

<p>
'As my merry little playmate when I
was a mere youth&mdash;the droll girl to whom
I was somehow tied up under Uncle
Raymond's will.'
</p>

<p>
'You phrase it rightly,' said she, biting
her coral nether lip.  'Tied up; yes, but
I won't be so.  Yet you did think of me
as a droll little playmate?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; how else could I think of you?
Not as the lovely girl I find you now,
Olive.'
</p>

<p>
'You may know by this time that I hate
all flattery,' said she, blushing hotly at
what she had brought upon herself by a
blunt reference to a hitherto ignored
subject&mdash;their mutual relation to each other.
</p>

<p>
'I have here a gift I brought you from
India,' observed Allan, timidly, as he
unlocked his desk and thought of the Maltese
ornaments, but did not dare refer to them
as yet.
</p>

<p>
'A gift?' said she, coldly, with face half
averted.
</p>

<p>
'A little silver idol of Siva, beautifully
carved and chased&mdash;will you accept of it?'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks&mdash;with pleasure,' said she,
trembling lest it had been a ring.  'How
curious, and yet how grotesquely hideous it
is!' she added, turning it round, and then
balancing it in the white palm of a slim
and delicate hand.
</p>

<p>
'And rather a curious story attends
it&mdash;if you care to hear.'
</p>

<p>
'Please to tell me,' said she, her
curiosity roused.  'Why, the funny thing has
ever so many heads, and a dozen of arms
at least!'
</p>

<p>
'We were in cantonments at Hurdwur,
in Delhi,' said Allan, glad to secure her
attention even for a few minutes, 'when
a subadar-major of the 10th Native Infantry,
a disciple of Siva, wishing to sacrifice
to his little idol, placed it by the bank of
the river there, which is one of the greatest
places for Hindoo purification, and the
resort of thousands of pilgrims from every
part of Hindostan.  While he turned aside
to get the ghee with which to anoint it,
some person adroitly carried it off.  After
searching for it in vain, with consternation
in his soul, the unfortunate subadar-major
went to the priest of the nearest temple,
and, with tears in his eyes, related his loss.
</p>

<p>
'"Dog!" exclaimed the priest, "you
have lost your god, and must prepare to
die, for death alone can soothe the wrath
of Siva."
</p>

<p>
'"If die I must," replied the wretched
subadar-major, with clasped hands and
trembling knees, though a brave man, as
the medals on his breast proved, "it shall
be by drowning in the holy river; so come
with me to the edge thereof, and give me
your blessing."
</p>

<p>
'The priest consented, and followed him
to the Ganges, into which he went deliberately.
</p>

<p>
'"Be courageous, my son&mdash;die with joy,
and perfect happiness awaits you,"
exclaimed the priest.
</p>

<p>
'"My dear master," said the subadar,
"before I perish, lend me <i>your</i> god that I
may adore it&mdash;the water is already up to
my neck."
</p>

<p>
'The priest consented, and handed his
idol to the subadar-major, who, as if by
accident, let it drop in the deep water.
</p>

<p>
'"Ah! master," he exclaimed, as if in
horror and dismay, "what a new
misfortune!  Your god is also lost, and so we
must die together&mdash;for you must drown,
too, and go with me to the throne of
Siva!"
</p>

<p>
'And, approaching the priest, he strove
to grasp the hand of the latter, who stood
pale and trembling on the lowest step of
the ghaut or landing-place.
</p>

<p>
'"What trash do you speak?" the priest
suddenly exclaimed, in great wrath; "can
there be any harm in losing a little image
of baked clay, not worth an anna!  I have
dozens of such in my temple close by; let
us each choose one, and keep silence on the
subject!"
</p>

<p>
'The subadar did so then, but chose
this fine silver one, which he bestowed on
me for kindness shown to him when
dying of a wound received in a skirmish,
and I brought it home as a bauble for you,
Cousin Olive.'
</p>

<p>
She placed the idol on the table, and
remained silent, while Allan eyed her
wistfully.
</p>

<p>
'Why is my presence so distasteful to
you?' he asked, after a minute's pause.
</p>

<p>
'Distasteful!  Oh!  Allan, don't say so,'
said she, impressed by the pathos of his
tone, but for a moment only; 'it is you
who think, or seem to think so.'
</p>

<p>
'Olive!' he exclaimed, a little impatiently
and reproachfully as he drew near her.
</p>

<p>
'There&mdash;there&mdash;that will do,' said she,
starting up, 'don't bring down the
ceiling on me&mdash;auntie more than all!'
</p>

<p>
And she swept from the room, leaving
the idol behind her.
</p>

<p>
Allan sighed with annoyance, and
addressed her no more during the whole of
that day.  She was conscious of this, for
she remarked to Lady Aberfeldie in the
evening,
</p>

<p>
'How odd&mdash;how strange Cousin Allan
is to me!'
</p>

<p>
'Strange?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, aunt.'
</p>

<p>
'I know not what you mean, Olive,' she
replied, a little gravely and severely; 'but
to me it seems that you are always strange,
and not my son, the Master.'
</p>

<p>
Lady Aberfeldie had a soft, but set face
of the classic type, with a mouth that,
though beautiful and aristocratic, could
become very fixed in expression at times,
and it seemed so now to Olive, thus that
young lady withdrew.
</p>

<p>
'Our Allan is young and handsome,
noble and most unselfishly in love with
her, as I am beginning to hope, Eveline, so
what more would Olive Raymond wish
for?' said Lady Aberfeldie to her daughter.
</p>

<p>
'She would have that, which she has
not, mamma, perfect freedom to accept or
refuse whom she chose.  Unselfish in love
I know Allan must be; but that is precisely
the point which Olive is left to doubt.'
</p>

<p>
'Wherefore?'
</p>

<p>
'Through that unlucky will, which
makes a kind of bondswoman of her.'
</p>

<p>
'I would to heaven the silly document
had never been framed!  I have often
feared that it might lead to all our attention,
care, and affection being misconstrued
by her; but Allan might have been sickly,
weakly, even deformed, and, with the terms
of this will hanging over her, what would
she have thought then?'
</p>

<p>
'Then, as I have heard her say, the will
might be reduced by a court of law.'
</p>

<p>
At this reply a clouded expression came
into the fair, colourless face of Lady
Aberfeldie, but just then a servant in the
Graham livery, yellow and black, approached
with a note on a salver.
</p>

<p>
'From papa!' she said, while cutting it
open with a mother-of-pearl knife.  'Just
a line or two to say he will be home in a
couple of days, and is certainly bringing
with him Mr. Hawke Holcroft, "the son
of his old friend," and that other young
detrimental, Stratherroch.  He is well-nigh
penniless, but, with your papa, to be
in the Black Watch is quite equal to a
patent of nobility.'
</p>

<p>
Eveline felt her colour fade, while a sad
expression stole over her soft face, and
her mother, after glancing at her
narrowly, added,
</p>

<p>
'He also brings our wealthy friend, Sir
Paget Puddicombe, the M.P. for
Slough-cum-Sloggit, in Yorkshire.  You remember
him in London last season, and how much
he admired you, dear?'
</p>

<p>
Eveline <i>did</i> remember him, and how the
rich but elderly baronet's attentions,
encouraged by her parents, were the ridicule
of her girl friends and the bane of her
existence; yet she only sighed and
remained silent, and, passing through a French
window, quitted the drawing-room to join
her brother, who was smoking a cigar on
the terrace, and teasing the peacocks as
they sat on the stately balustrade.
</p>

<p>
He was in rather a similar mood.  He
felt the demeanour of Olive after the little
episode of the idol keenly, and, remembering
the pencilled Byron, was, of course,
inclined to connect Hawke Holcroft with
that demeanour; so he had certainly
become, for a time, cold and constrained in
manner to his cousin.
</p>

<p>
'When was that photo of Olive done?'
he asked, rather abruptly.
</p>

<p>
'The one in the ball dress?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'When we were last in Edinburgh; but
I do not remember where the studio was.'
</p>

<p>
'She gave one to that Mr. Holcroft.'
</p>

<p>
'I was quite unaware that she did so,'
said Eveline, with some annoyance of
manner.
</p>

<p>
'Look here, Eve, if, when in London,'
grumbled Allan, 'she shies her photos
about in this fashion they will soon be in
every fellow's possession, and we may,
ere long, expect to find them, like those
of professional beauties, on glove and
match-boxes.'
</p>

<p>
'What a funny and horrid idea!' said
his sister, passing her arm through his and
nestling her head on his shoulder, while
he, stooping, kissed her <i>mignonne</i> face with
a smiling caress.
</p>

<p>
'There is nothing funny about it,' he
replied, though, like her, he could little
foresee the trouble that unlucky photograph
was to cost in the future.  'And, to
say the least of it, Olive treats me with
almost hostility at times.'
</p>

<p>
'She does not conceal from me a
resentment at her lack of free will.'
</p>

<p>
'As for Uncle Raymond's arrangements,
I would to goodness that he had left all
he had to his old housekeeper and her
infernal screeching cockatoo with the
yellow tuft.'
</p>

<p>
'Certainly Olive does not seem to be the
kind of girl to be disposed of against her
wish, Allan; you may read that in the firm
tread of her little feet, in the carriage of
her head, and the perfect possession of her
manner.'
</p>

<p>
'But surely she may be won&mdash;though
she will not understand me.'
</p>

<p>
'I hope she will ere long; but is there
not a writer who says, Allan, that while
the world lasts the difficulty of women
understanding and making allowance for
the feelings of men in what pertains to
love, "will be probably one of the great
sources of darkness and confusion in the
social arrangement of things."'
</p>

<p>
'What a dear little casuist it is,' said he,
as she raised her <i>petite</i> figure on tip-toe to
kiss his well-tanned cheek; 'but,' he added,
'I am in a state of great uncertainty.'
</p>

<p>
'Uncertainty can always be ended; but
then perhaps how bitterly&mdash;how very
bitterly,' replied Eveline, who was not
without some harrowing thoughts of her own;
and something in her tone caused Allan
to regard her soft hazel eyes, and sweet,
shy face, with tenderness and inquiry.
</p>

<p>
'Of what are you thinking, or of&mdash;<i>whom</i>?'
he whispered, as his arm went
caressing round her, and he stroked her
bright, sheeny hair.
</p>

<p>
'I may trust you, Allan?' she said, in a
broken voice.
</p>

<p>
'To death, <i>petite</i>.  You are thinking
of&mdash;of Evan Cameron?'
</p>

<p>
Eveline sobbed now.
</p>

<p>
'Has he spoken of love to you?' asked
Allan, in a low voice, and with a troubled
expression in his face.
</p>

<p>
'Never; he knows it would be hopeless,'
she replied, huskily.
</p>

<p>
'Poor Evan! and the governor is bringing
him again&mdash;a grand mistake!  How
the deuce is all this to end with us?  But
don't sob so, my little darling,' he added,
as he drew her closer to him.
</p>

<p>
Yet, despite her brother's sympathy and
tenderness, Eveline Graham let her tears
flow freely, and he promised to keep her
secret that she and Evan Cameron cherished
an unspoken and hopeless love for
each other; and in a brief space they were
to meet again!
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, though somewhat relieved
by having her brother for a confidant, she
was both restless and unhappy.  She
strolled upon the terrace to feed the
peacocks, or wandered listlessly in the garden,
going from occupation to occupation,
taking up a book&mdash;one of Mudie's last&mdash;only
to toss it aside; seated herself before the
piano, rose then and left it.  Anon she
resorted to her sketching-block, sorted her
colours, selected a brush, only to quit any
attempt to work with a hopeless sigh.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
THE CHAGRIN OF LOVE.
</h3>

<p>
Lord Aberfeldie duly arrived at Dundargue
with his three gentlemen visitors, their
approach being heralded by the pipes of
Ronald Gair, who was perched on a seat
of the game-laden wagonette as it bowled
up the avenue.
</p>

<p>
On the first day of his return the peer
was anxious to learn upon what footing
the cousins were&mdash;if Allan had made a
proposal, or 'even opened the trenches,'
and if so, with what success.  On these
points he was enlightened by Lady Aberfeldie,
and, though not very much surprised
to find matters as they were, he trusted
to propinquity and cousinly feeling of
intercourse, as trump cards in the game, and
was sure that all would come right in the
end, and before Allan's leave of absence
was out.
</p>

<p>
There was no selfishness in this desire
of Lord Aberfeldie.  He had no power to
alter the matter as it stood, for if she did
not marry Allan if he was willing to marry
her, 'then and in that case,' as the will
had it, her patrimony would be lost even
to herself.  Allan's death alone would save
it for her.
</p>

<p>
Great indeed, thought the girl with
bitterness, must have been her father's regard
for the house of Aberfeldie!
</p>

<p>
'What friends&mdash;such lovers we might
be but for the confounded plans of that
eccentric old fellow!' was the ever-recurring
thought of Allan.
</p>

<p>
'You are at least fond of her?' said the
peer, as he and his son smoked their
cigars together on the terrace that
overlooked the far-stretching vista of the Carse
of Gowrie, then bathed in the ruddy splendour
of the setting sun.
</p>

<p>
'Fond of Olive!  Yes, as much as she
will permit me to be.  She is my cousin,
of course,' replied Allan.
</p>

<p>
'There is something evasive&mdash;doubtful&mdash;in
your answer; but you must at some
time or other propose to her.  You know
precisely the terms of her father's
remarkable will.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, and that it hangs like a millstone
round the necks of us both, rendering
what may be the dearest wish of our
hearts liable, perhaps, to the grossest
misconstruction.  She has more than once
told Eveline that to gain freedom of action
she would face poverty&mdash;anything.'
</p>

<p>
'Tuts!  Romantic rant!  Much she
knows of what poverty is.  But why
should she even think of facing it?'
</p>

<p>
'To be free and unfettered, as I have
said.'
</p>

<p>
'Relinquishing to you all that portion
of her fortune which does not go to
charitable institutions?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Poor girl!  A silly and impetuous
threat.  But she will think better of it,
Allan, by-and-by, and we have fully five
years to count upon yet.'
</p>

<p>
But it did not seem as if the fair Olive
was likely to change her mind soon, to
judge by her bearing that evening, when,
after dinner, the guests and family at
Dundargue assembled in the drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
The repast was over, and thereafter,
ere the ladies withdrew, Ronald Gair, with
all his drones in order, his Crimean,
Indian, and Ashanti medals glittering on
his breast, had marched thrice round the
table, according to his daily wont, in 'full
fig,' looking as only a Highland piper or a
peacock can look; and, to the amazement
of Sir Paget Puddicombe and the disgust
of Hawke Holcroft, winding up 'The
Birks of Aberfeldie' by several warlike
skirls at the back of his master's chair&mdash;the
dinner, we say, was over, and the
gentlemen had joined the ladies in the
stately drawing-room, which was lighted
by more than one glittering chandelier.
</p>

<p>
Lord Aberfeldie, his son, and Stratherroch,
as they wore the kilt, had, of course,
substituted for their rough shooting-jackets
others of black cloth, with the
irreproachable white vests and ties as
evening costume, and had also assumed
their silver-mounted dirks; while
Holcroft and one or two more were <i>de rigueur</i>
in the funereal attire, which a writer calls
'the butler-suit, the most hideous clothing
yet hit upon by our species.'
</p>

<p>
In that brilliant drawing-room, grouped
with well-bred people, were some curious
elements of secret doubt and future
discord that did not quite meet the eye.
</p>

<p>
Holcroft hung over the chair of Olive
so closely that, at times, the tip of his
long and waxed tawny moustache nearly
touched her head, while she played with
her fan, opening and shutting it listlessly
as they conversed in low tones, he adopting
a sentimental one, though it was ever
his boast that he 'was not one of those
fools who hoard by them dried flowers,
locks of hair, and all that sort of thing.'
</p>

<p>
Quietly watched by Lady Aberfeldie,
whose lips wore their set expression, Evan
Cameron was entirely occupied with her
daughter, while Allan seemed quite as
intent on a new guest, Miss Logan of
Loganlee, a girl possessed of considerable
personal attractions; and his father talked
politics with Loganlee himself, the parish
minister, and Sir Paget Puddicombe, a
short, pompous, and squat, but rather
pleasant little man, with a prematurely
bald head, which he had a way of jerking
forward from his neck like a turtle, a
rubicund face, two merry eyes, and whose
age was rather doubtful, but too old any
way for a girl of Eveline Graham's years,
though he affected considerable juvenility
of manner.
</p>

<p>
Lord Aberfeldie, who generally about
that time, when at Dundargue, was wont
to enjoy a quiet little game of chess or
bezique with Olive or Eveline, was rather
bored by the <i>empressement</i> with which the
clergyman, Sir Paget, and Loganlee
discussed politics and the prospects of the
ministry.
</p>

<p>
The latter, a sombre man, whose air of
respectability was almost oppressive, was
one of a style of men common enough in
Scotland.  A small landed proprietor, he
had contrived to become M.P. in the
Liberal interest for a cluster of Scottish
burghs (each of which, if in England,
would have had two members), and
he was chiefly noted&mdash;being 'Parliament
House bred'&mdash;for neglecting Scottish
interests and toadying to the Lord-Advocate,
and consequently obtained the usual legal
reward, a sheriffship, or something of that
kind, with a thousand a year or so.
</p>

<p>
He seldom opened his mouth, save to
talk on politics; he was tall and thin, with
very square shoulders, grizzled, sandy,
mutton-chop whiskers, apple-green eyes,
and nothing more about him remarkable,
save a curious air of perpetual self-assertion,
combined, as we have said, with an
oppressive one of respectability.
</p>

<p>
His host began to change the tenor of the
conversation by hoping that Sir Paget found
his quarters comfortable last night, adding
that he occupied 'the Johnson Room.'
</p>

<p>
'Why is it so called?' asked Sir Paget,
jerking forward his bald head.
</p>

<p>
'Dr. Johnson slept a night in Dundargue
when on his famous tour.'
</p>

<p>
'Of which Boswell makes no mention?'
said Mr. Logan, inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
'Because my ancestor did not pay him
sufficient deference; and, indeed, I fear
we should scarcely ever have heard of the
literary bear of Bolt Court and Fleet Street
but for that Scotch toady of his.  Though
he alleged that the most valuable piece
of timber in Scotland was his walking-stick,
he might have seen some fine trees
at the Birks of Aberfeldy.  We must ride
over there, Sir Paget, and I will show you
the cradle of the Black Watch, my old
regiment of immortal memory.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'It was first mustered there on the 25th
of October, 1739.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah!' said Sir Paget, who was not so
much interested in the matter as the
speaker.
</p>

<p>
Sir Paget was a childless widower, and
had been left a noble fortune in many
ways, including nearly the whole of
Slough-cum-Sloggit, of which his father
rose by his own merits to be mayor.  He
had entered the town a tattered lad, with
only a sixpence in his pocket, and, in
due time, the sixpence became the basis
of colossal wealth.  He had been made
a baronet by the ministry of the day&mdash;no
one knew precisely for what; but the
wealth he left behind him gave his son
an interest in the eyes of Lady Aberfeldie
he was unlikely to attain in the soft hazel
orbs of her daughter.
</p>

<p>
Sir Paget generally stood with his chest
puffed out, reminding one of a pouter-pigeon,
his little, fat hands interlaced
behind his back, and often as not under
the tails of his coat, his round,
good-humoured face and twinkling eyes turned
up to the faces of those with whom he
conversed, as most men, and women, too,
had the advantage of him in stature.
</p>

<p>
With a gold <i>pince-nez</i> balanced on his
very pug nose, he was what young ladies
described as 'an absurd little man' whose
tender speeches they laughed at&mdash;none
more than Eveline&mdash;till matters took a
serious turn, though he failed to feel the
truth of the aphorism, 'Let no lover
cherish sanguine hopes when the object
of his choice has grown to look upon him
in the light of the ridiculous.'
</p>

<p>
Evan Cameron, we have said, sighed
for Eveline; hopeless as his undeclared
love had been, the presence of the wealthy
English baronet, in conjunction with
certain rumours he had heard, made it more
hopeless than ever; and, unattractive
though Sir Paget's years and figure, he
felt intuitively that in him he had a
dangerous rival.
</p>

<p>
When he found that this most eligible
<i>parti</i> was again on the <i>tapis</i>&mdash;one whose
name had been associated with that of
Eveline in at least one 'society' paper
during the last London season, poor
Stratherroch's heart sank down to zero.  He
felt and knew that, with Lady Aberfeldie
especially, he was literally 'nowhere' by
his want of wealth, though, like a true
Highlander, he could trace his lineage
back into the misty times of Celtic
antiquity; but, aristocratic though she was,
the peeress set little store on that.
</p>

<p>
Eveline Graham seemed as much beyond
his reach as the moon.  He felt that, for
his own peace of mind, he ought to quit
Dundargue as soon as possible, yet he
clung desperately to the perilous delight
of the girl's society.
</p>

<p>
To all appearance, the pair were simply
looking over, almost in silence, a large
book of clear-skied and strongly-shadowed
photos of Indian scenery brought home
by Allan, yet both their hearts had but a
single thought, and, when the downward
glance of his soft grey eyes met hers, she
felt that, in spite of herself, there was
something in it like a magnetic spell.
</p>

<p>
Passionate and pleading eyes they were,
generous and loving in expression, telling
the tale his lips had not yet uttered, and
might never do so; and the girl lowered
her white lids as if a weight oppressed
them, and the diamond locket on her white
bosom sparkled as a sigh escaped her.
</p>

<p>
A little way off, in something of the
same pose, Hawke Holcroft, with a glass
in his pale, sinister eye, was hanging, as
we have said, over Olive Raymond, doing
his utmost in <i>sotto voce</i> to fascinate that
young lady, while pretending to translate,
as suited the occasion and himself, for the
edification of his fair listener, the
lettering of one of the Chinese or Japanese
fans that were strewed about the tables.
</p>

<p>
Now, Mr. Hawke Holcroft knew nothing
about the terms of Mr. Raymond's will, or
of the existence of any such document, and
might never know.  He was only certain
that Olive was undoubtedly an heiress;
that he himself was very impecunious, and
ere long might be well-nigh desperate; and
so he did not see why he should not, to
use his own horsey phraseology, 'enter
stakes as well as another.'
</p>

<p>
Rumour, certainly, had linked the names
of the cousins together; 'but if she is
engaged to Graham,' thought the observant
Holcroft, 'it is strange that she wears no
engagement ring.'
</p>

<p>
He knew not that, separated as the pair
had been almost from childhood, no such
little formality as the presentation of a
ring could have been gone through; and
now, as the Master did not see his way to it
as yet, Holcroft was 'scoring,'or thought so.
</p>

<p>
He was leaving nothing unsaid to
enchain her attention.  He seemed very
clever: at least he could converse fluently
on many subjects; seemed to have been
everywhere and to have seen everything
worth seeing, or pretended to have done
so, which was most likely.
</p>

<p>
'However they stand, her heart is not
in it,' was his ever-recurring thought; 'and
if so, why the deuce shouldn't I try my
hand?  She has a pot of money&mdash;indeed,
no end of money, I hear; but, then, if her
noble aunt and uncle have made up their
noble minds to pounce upon her as a
daughter-in-law, how is she to resist, unless
she elopes, if "Barkis" (meaning Allan)
"is willin'"?  They can make her life a
burden to her until she gives in, or&mdash;or I
run away with her, and why the devil
should I not?'
</p>

<p>
Holcroft was an artful man, and well
acquainted with every phase of dissipated
life; he had suave manners when he chose
and an unexceptionable appearance.  With
many debts and secret passions, he was
cold and selfish; a man who never made a
move in any way without forecast and
calculation; and who might commit a crime
if driven to it, but never precisely a folly.
</p>

<p>
He was closely watching Olive while he
conversed with her; he admired her beautiful
person, but still more her ample purse.
She dared to trifle with him at times, he
thought; and then, even when looking
down upon her satin-like hair, her dazzling
white shoulders and innocent violet eyes,
with a vengeful feeling he mentally vowed
that he would <i>compel</i> her to love him, or
accept him, he cared not which, if human
will and cunning failed him not!
</p>

<p>
He had a love&mdash;a passion for her&mdash;in a
strange fashion of his own, yet times there
were when he almost hated her for fencing
with him: and little could the soft, bright
beauty, who raised her fine eyes from time
to time to his and conversed so laughingly
with him, have conceived the conflicting
emotions that were concealed in his breast
under a smiling exterior, or the shame and
agony he was yet to cost her.
</p>

<p>
Even when he attempted to look loving,
there were a cold expression and lack of
colour in his eyes, and there was something
very significant of an iron will about
his lips and powerful chin.
</p>

<p>
Olive had no warm feeling for Holcroft,
and save for the obnoxious will would
infinitely have preferred her cousin Allan
in the end; but she affected just then to
believe in Platonic friendship (blended
with a little judicious flirtation) so firmly
that, to pique Allan, she showed a great
apparent preference for his would-be
rival.
</p>

<p>
Olive and Holcroft knew that this seeming
flirtation was perilous work, and might
compromise them both with Lord and
Lady Aberfeldie, and with Allan, too, if it
attracted attention; but Holcroft had a
game to play.  Olive's proud little heart
was full of resentment and pique, and then
anything with a spice of danger in it is
always curiously fascinating.
</p>

<p>
More than all, Olive was beginning to
feel conscious that, under the circumstances,
it was strangely awkward to be in
the same house with Allan Graham&mdash;the
intended husband to whom her father had
bequeathed her.  But whither could she go?
</p>

<p>
In more than one instance, in the drawing-room
at Dundargue, that night was
illustrated the aphorism that language is
given us to conceal our thoughts, and
much was exhibited of what the French
not inaptly term the chagrin or peevishness
of love.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
LE CHAGRIN D'AMOUR.
</h3>

<p>
Allan Graham, with all his quiet and
growing love for Olive, seeing how she
received him, neither petted her as he was
wont to do in his boyhood, nor after a time
had attempted any tenderness with her;
but trusted to the progress of events and
the necessity for fulfilling her father's wish
rather than to his own influence or power
of persuasion, aware that she could only
become the bride of another, penniless, or
nearly so, a circumstance which militated
sadly against himself.
</p>

<p>
But this assumed coldness and calmness
withal, Olive could feel, with a woman's
acuteness in such matters, how much the
expression of his dark eyes and the tone
of his voice changed and softened,
unconsciously, when he looked at and addressed
her.  She was of his own blood, like a
sister, whom he might treat with formality
or affection, coldly or playfully, according
to the occasion or the mood, and whom he
might love as much as he liked, or she
would permit.  Ah! this tender and
mysterious tie of cousinship must give
him, as he thought, 'a great pull' over
Hawke Holcroft, and every other man.
</p>

<p>
On this evening, how handsome she
looked, in all her wilfullness!  How Allan
longed that he might take her in his
embrace, to kiss her starry eyes, her
peach-like cheek, and sheeny hair with an
ardour he had never felt in his boyhood,
when he had done so many times; but
now, somehow, he dared scarcely think of
such a thing, and there was that fellow
Holcroft, with all his easy insouciance, and
with the smile of one who never laughed
really in his life, hanging just rather too
much over her, with a considerable amount
of empressement in his eyes and manner,
pouring his flowery nothings into her
apparently willing ear, and Lady
Aberfeldie, who could stand this no longer,
became secretly provoked, and opened and
shut her fan of heavy mother-of-pearl with
such vehemence that the sticks rattled.
</p>

<p>
And, with the emotions we have described
in his heart, Allan, as if the further
to play out the game of cross-purposes, in
a spirit of pique, doubtless, remained in
close attendance on Miss Ruby Logan.
</p>

<p>
Now the latter was not the heiress of
Loganlee, as she had several brothers; but,
even had she been so, it would not have
enhanced her value in the ambitious
estimation of Lady Aberfeldie.
</p>

<p>
But Ruby was a very handsome girl,
with a skin pure, transparent, and delicate
as the lining of a shell, while her fine hair
was ample in quantity, and of the darkest
amber; her eyes large, deep-blue, and
fringed by dark lashes.  She was large,
full in form, and altogether a bright and
attractive-looking girl, and Olive felt
conscious that she might prove rather a
formidable rival if she ever had to view her as
such.
</p>

<p>
Replacing the three daughters of the
minister of Dundargue, who had been
afflicting the company with much boarding-school
Mozart and Chopin, who would have
deemed anything national vulgar, to say the
least of it, compared with some lachrymose
drawing-room ballad, and who in a ditty of
great length and mystery, which we quote at
second hand, had informed their hearers&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Mermaids we be,<br />
  Under the blue sea'&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
replacing them, we say, Ruby Logan sang
to Allan in a rich mezzo-soprano voice,
and with a suppressed emotion, born
perhaps of a coquettish desire to dazzle and
please him, as a handsome young fellow of
good position, all of which proved a fresh
annoyance to my Lady Aberfeldie, who
deemed music at times 'a convenient noise
for drowning conversation, and under
whose shelter the old people talk scandal
and the young people make love,' and who
knew that Miss Logan, like Olive, had
that wonderful charm, which is, perhaps,
one of the greatest any girl can possess, a
lovely and ever-changing expression; and
even Allan, as he gazed down into the
depths of her dark-blue eyes (while she
sang <i>at</i> him), and anon glanced furtively at
Olive, thought to himself,
</p>

<p>
'How the dickens <i>will</i> our little game of
cross-purposes end?'
</p>

<p>
Lady Aberfeldie was just then indulging
in the same surmise, as, full of
watchfulness, she occupied an ottoman in the
centre of the inner drawing-room, cresting
up her white throat and well-shaped head;
looking in her stately beauty like the
heroine of some grand old Scottish
romance of the days of Montrose or Prince
Charles, for there was something of a past
age in her style and bearing, though
attired in the latest fashion by a modiste
of Princes Street.
</p>

<p>
In her matronhood, Lady Aberfeldie
had still that subdued charm which was
not now the beauty of youth, yet stood
very much in place of it; but, with all her
softness of manner, she was a proud and
determined woman, capable of doing much
to accomplish a purpose of her own, and
the marriage of Eveline to Sir Paget
Puddicombe was certainly her purpose at
present.
</p>

<p>
Thinking that it was high time to make
some change in the general grouping, the
moment Miss Logan's musical performance
was done she summoned Allan to her side
by a wave of her fan.
</p>

<p>
'So glad I am that your father, who so
often mistakes, invited dear Sir Paget
here,' she said, in low voice.
</p>

<p>
'He is rather a good sort,' replied Allan,
in his off-hand way; 'capital cellar and
preserves, I have heard.'
</p>

<p>
'So rich, and not <i>very</i> old; he always
admired Eveline, and she certainly cares
for no one else&mdash;thus I have great hopes
for her, Allan,' she added, confidently; but
Allan sighed; he knew better, and recalled
the tears of his gentle sister on the
terrace, and her half murmured admissions of
deep interest in that winsome young
brother-officer, whom he loved so well;
and, as he remained silent, his mother
spoke again.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Holcroft seems to be fairly absorbing
Olive; he has been talking to her quite
long enough, and this will not do; ask her
to play something at my request, and do
you lead her to the piano.'
</p>

<p>
'We are anticipated,' said Allan, as he
saw his sister seat herself at the
instrument with young Cameron by her side,
busy among the leaves of her music; and
a shade of annoyance deepened in the face
of Lady Aberfeldie as she glanced at her
husband, whose eyes were turned also
towards the pair, and she knew from
personal experience how much may be inferred
or deduced from the words of a song, and
also how many a tender speech, an
accompaniment, however ill or well executed,
may conceal.
</p>

<p>
Lord Aberfeldie, of course, would never
consent to Eveline having a suitor with
means so limited as those of her young
admirer; but, though the idea of such a
contingency had not occurred to him.  Lady
Aberfeldie was much sharper and more
suspicious; she saw 'how the tide set,'
and was much opposed to Cameron being
even a visitor at Dundargue in any
way, as an utter 'detrimental,' and
declined to see how his being one of
'Ours'&mdash;the Black Watch&mdash;altered <i>that</i>
matter.
</p>

<p>
And now, after a considerable amount
of preluding, much unnecessary whispering,
as 'my lady' thought, much glancing
and many reciprocal smiles, Evan Cameron
began to sing, accompanied by her
daughter; and more annoyed became the matron
on finding the theme chosen one of love
and tenderness that could be, and was,
sung with considerable <i>point</i>&mdash;a now
forgotten little Scotch song, which the author
adapted to the air of 'Rousseau's Dream,'
and with the desire to excel before the girl
he loved better than life, young Cameron,
gave his whole soul to the lyric.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'See the moon o'er cloudless Jura<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shining in the loch below;<br />
  See the distant mountain towering<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a pyramid of snow.<br />
  Scenes of grandeur&mdash;scenes of childhood&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scenes so dear to love and me!<br />
  Let us roam by bower and wild wood,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All is lovelier when with <i>thee</i>.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'On Jura's hills the winds are sighing,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all is silent in the grove;<br />
  And the leaves with dewdrops glistening<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sparkle like the eye of love.<br />
  Night so calm, so clear, so cloudless,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessed night to love and me;<br />
  Let us roam by bower and fountain,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All is lovelier when with <i>thee</i>.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And it was not unnoticed by Lady
Aberfeldie that at the closing word of each
verse the eyes of the pair unconsciously
met.  Ere Eveline could be prevented,
she had acceded to Cameron's softly uttered
desire that she would sing anything for
<i>him</i>; and she frankly did so, throwing into
her voice the thrill and tenderness that
are sure to come into a girl's utterances
when singing to the man she loves.  The
heart of Cameron responded to this
mysterious influence, and, as the girl regarded
him furtively from time to time, she
thought, with his crisp wavy hair, his clear
grey eyes, general expression and bearing,
he looked every inch what he was, the
descendant of that Sir Evan Cameron of
Lochiel who met Cromwell's men in
combat under the shadow of Ben Nevis; yet
to other eyes he seemed just a good sample
of an infantryman who had across his
forehead the genuine sunmark of his craft,
made under the line of his forage-cap by a
scorching tropical sun.
</p>

<p>
And now when Lady Aberfeldie, to stop
any more musical performances between
these two, prevailed upon Olive to replace
her cousin, she was quick enough to
detect that the former, displeased or piqued
by Allan's apparent attention to Ruby
Logan, swept past him with the most
subtle little touch of disdain in the
carriage of her handsome head.
</p>

<p>
Now Cameron had once more to give
place to pudgy little Sir Paget, who&mdash;puffing
out his chest and jerking forward his
bald shining head&mdash;began to do his best
to make himself pleasing to Eveline, while
the latter, under her mother's watchful
eye, was compelled to listen and appear to
act with compliance and complacency; and
poor Eveline, like Olive, often felt with
some compunction that her mother's
general bearing&mdash;which a certain quiet yet
lofty dignity seemed never to forsake&mdash;was
more calculated to inspire respect than
love.
</p>

<p>
And Cameron, while he found himself
talking rather absently on regimental
matters with Lord Aberfeldie, as he looked at
Eveline from time to time, was thinking
sadly in his honest heart,
</p>

<p>
'Oh, what madness it is in me to love
her as I do, and how wicked if I lure her
into loving me!  Can I expect her ambitious
mother or her calculating father ever
to view with favour one so penniless as I
am?  Would it be honourable in me to
profit by her girlish prepossession in my
favour, and so preclude her from reaping
those advantages of wealth, position, and
rank which she is entitled to expect, and
to which her parents looked forward? and
alas! as the wife of Sir Paget&mdash;if such be
her fate&mdash;poor Eveline will be lost for ever
to me.'
</p>

<p>
His breast felt torn by such thoughts
as these; and, sooth to say, it is as often
amid the splendour and luxury of life, as
amid its squalor and poverty, that some of
its bitterest tragedies are acted out.
</p>

<p>
But now the party began to break up&mdash;the
ladies to seek their respective apartments,
and the gentlemen to adjourn for
a time to the smoking-room.
</p>

<p>
As the two cousins, each so different in
her style of loveliness, crossed the great
apartment, the soft <i>frou-frou</i> of their long
silken dresses seemed to mingle with their
soft laughter and silvery voices.  Sir Paget
jerked forward his head and remarked to
his hostess that 'they made a charming
picture.'
</p>

<p>
Each had a sore place in her heart, but
there was no appearance of it then.
</p>

<p>
Though resenting the position in which
she was placed, and much inclined to resist
it, Olive Raymond&mdash;such is female caprice&mdash;also
resented Allan's having hovered so
much about the amber-haired beauty, and,
when she bade him adieu for the night,
she could not help singing softly, with
some point and waggery, as she glanced
back at him, the lines of Tennyson's song:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'I know a maiden fair to see,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take care!<br />
  She can both false and friendly be,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beware, beware!<br />
  Trust her not, she is fooling thee.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
But whether she applied the words to
herself or Ruby Logan it puzzled him to divine.
</p>

<p>
Olive and Eveline were of an age, and
able to sympathise with each other in
every thought or fancy.  They had grown
up together like sisters, Olive, as an
orphan, doubtless being the most petted
of the two by the household ever since she
came a little child to Dundargue, and both
were frank, both were open-hearted, and
proud of each other's personal attractions;
and now, dismissing their maids, they
brushed out each other's shining hair that
they might have a quiet gossip together.
</p>

<p>
'So ends a tiresome night,' said Eveline,
shrugging her white shoulders, which
shone like ivory in the light of the toilette
candles: 'a night when the conversation
of everyone seemed of a nature so antagonistic,
or as if it was all broken up into
wrong duets.'
</p>

<p>
Like her father, Eveline was anxious to
discover how the cousins were affected
towards each other now; yet the course of
this evening, in which Allan had plainly
flirted with Ruby Logan, while Olive
seemed to have been engrossed by
Mr. Holcroft, did not seem to promise much,
and she hinted this pretty plainly.
</p>

<p>
'I do think Holcroft loves me, or leads
me to infer that he does,' said Olive, with
a soft smile on her downcast face, as she
took off her rings, bangles, and bracelets,
and tossed them on the marble toilette-table.'
</p>

<p>
'And you&mdash;what is your feeling for
him?' asked Eveline, with some anxiety
in her face and tone; 'not love, I hope.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't know what I feel&mdash;perhaps it
is only a girl's emotion of gratitude and
vanity.'
</p>

<p>
'I hope it will never be anything more.
You scarcely spoke to poor Allan to-night?'
said Eveline, interrogatively.
</p>

<p>
'Rather say he scarcely spoke to me!
But we are fated to see quite enough of
each other, I suppose,' replied Olive, as
with slender fingers she coiled and knotted
up the silky masses of her rich brown hair.
'How absurd it is,' she added, petulantly,
'to think, as I have said a hundred times,
that I have a lover cut and dry for me&mdash;a
<i>fiancé</i>&mdash;ever since he was in jackets and
knickerbockers!'
</p>

<p>
After a pause, during which she was
critically and approvingly regarding
herself sideways in the swinging cheval-glass,
she said,
</p>

<p>
'When I heard that he was returning
to Dundargue, I was quite prepared to
dislike him intensely.'
</p>

<p>
'Olive!'
</p>

<p>
'Fact, dear; and since then he must
have been sorely puzzled by my various
moods towards him.'
</p>

<p>
'You speak but with truth in this; and
yet he seems to have been somewhat the
same with you.'
</p>

<p>
'Poor fellow&mdash;but ever so good and kind.'
</p>

<p>
'And&mdash;and you think, Olive dear, that
you are beginning to love him as mamma
wishes?'
</p>

<p>
'Nay&mdash;nay, I cannot admit that.'
</p>

<p>
'Even to me?' said Eveline, caressing her.
</p>

<p>
'Even to you.  Did you not see his
manner to-night with Ruby Logan?'
</p>

<p>
'To pique you, if possible, Olive; but
when Allan proposes to you, as I am sure
he will, and must do&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Must</i> do!' interrupted Olive.  'Yes&mdash;there
it is.'
</p>

<p>
'Well?'
</p>

<p>
'Then, and in that case, as the will has
it, I shall tell him that, however I may
esteem and regard him as my cousin, he
can never be more, or nearer, or dearer
than as such.'
</p>

<p>
Eveline sighed and smiled; but she told
this reply next day to Allan, and hence he
became less in a hurry to bring matters to
an issue, though love was growing in his
heart, nevertheless.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, why is it that women cannot speak
their minds as men do?  I wish I dared
run away!' exclaimed the petulant beauty,
beating the carpet with a little impatient
foot.  'To-day I saw two great brown
eagles winging their way skyward from
the rock of Dundargue; and oh! Eveline,
you can't think how long and wistfully I
watched them till they dwindled into tiny
specks.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'They seemed such free agents, and, as
such, to be envied.  They had no wills or
last testaments made by others to control
their actions&mdash;no parents to rule them in
the matters of love and marriage.'
</p>

<p>
'How droll you are, Olive!  To whom
but you would such speculations occur?
I hope you did not express them to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Allan?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Not to Allan.'
</p>

<p>
'To whom then?'
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Holcroft.'
</p>

<p>
'Then, you were very wrong to do so,'
said Eveline, almost severely; 'he will be
certain to draw his own deductions therefrom.'
</p>

<p>
'In something else I was, I fear, wrong too.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'I permitted him to try one of my gold
bangles&mdash;one sent me by Allan from Delhi&mdash;on
his arm, and it would not come off again.'
</p>

<p>
'And the bangle?'
</p>

<p>
'Is still there,' said Olive, laughing, but
not without a little emotion of alarm.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Olive!' exclaimed Eveline, with
something of dismay, 'how could you?
This is worse than the photo.'

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
THE RIDING-PARTY.
</h3>

<p>
For some time the days passed on as they
generally do in a country-house like
Dundargue, and there was all the usual flow
of life and&mdash;with three exceptions, Sir
Paget, Holcroft, and Cameron&mdash;change of
guests and visitors, with the amusements
wealth can give.
</p>

<p>
First came the partridge-shooting, and
then the pheasants were to be knocked
over, while the ladies drove almost daily
to the preserves with the luncheon in the
drag or large pony-carriage; there were
hunting days, dinners, luncheons, musical
evenings, carpet dances, and so forth, and
the inevitable lawn-tennis, with the ladies
in bewitching costumes; but still Allan,
damped perhaps by his sister's communications,
'made no way' with his tantalising
cousin, and Hawke Holcroft, on Lord
Aberfeldie's invitation, was still lingering
at Dundargue.
</p>

<p>
To Allan, Olive had become a part of
his life, and each day seemed only to begin
when he met her at breakfast in her
charming morning toilette, fresh from her
bath and the hands of Mademoiselle Clairette,
her hair dressed to perfection, and
her face radiant with health and beauty.
</p>

<p>
'How often do I wish she had not a
<i>sous</i>!' sighed Allan.  'Then she might
learn that I love her for herself alone.'
</p>

<p>
The curious position in which they were
placed relatively made the cousins most
strange to each other, involving much
constraint.
</p>

<p>
'They are fencing with their feelings,'
was Lord Aberfeldie's conviction.
</p>

<p>
To Evan Cameron, however, it was
evident that Holcroft was 'making all the
running he could' during Allan's absences
after the game, or apparent occupation
with laughing Ruby Logan, while it became
evident to Sir Paget and more than one
other guest that he got up many a quiet
game at <i>ecarté</i>&mdash;that most rooking of all
games&mdash;and many a match at billiards
after the ladies had retired; and it was
soon remarked by the same close observers
that he was a singularly successful player,
often pocketing large sums, seldom losing,
and then very slenderly, as if to keep up
appearances.
</p>

<p>
At Dundargue he felt himself in clover!
He knew, or was aware instinctively, that
neither Lady Aberfeldie nor the Master
cared much about him; but he also knew
that his host was inspired by the kindliest
feelings towards him as the only son of an
early friend and gallant old Crimean
comrade who had gone to his long home.
</p>

<p>
If any rule governed the erratic life of
the horsey and gambling Holcroft, it was
that of resolutely shutting his eyes against
to-morrow, and letting it take care of
itself; and, now that there was a prospect
of winning a wife with money&mdash;and such
a chance seldom came his way&mdash;could he
but play his cards well and surely, his
fortune would be made!
</p>

<p>
He was a mass of absolute selfishness&mdash;the
result either of his innate nature or of
his nomadic habits.  A life-long bankrupt,
he had been ever readier to borrow than
to lend, to smoke any other fellow's cigars
than his own, and to take every advantage
of the honourable and unsuspecting.
</p>

<p>
Such was the perilous inmate which a
mistaken sense of kindness, gratitude, and
hospitality had induced Lord Aberfeldie to
make one of the family circle at Dundargue
during the shooting season; and to
whom the advent of the bangle&mdash;which,
though it slipped easily upon his wrist,
most mysteriously would not come off it&mdash;and
other adventitious circumstances, the
real cause of which he did not know, gave
a considerable amount of what he termed
to himself 'modest assurance' and
confidence of ultimate success.
</p>

<p>
'I should like to come into a nice little
pot of money&mdash;a fortune, if you will&mdash;but
not with a girl tacked to it,' he said, on
one occasion, to throw Allan 'off the
scent,' as he thought.  'I am neither
domestic nor ambitious.  A few thousands
would do.'
</p>

<p>
'And make you content?'
</p>

<p>
'Content!  I should feel as happy as
more than once I have been at Monaco,
when I have seen the croupier's rake
pushing a jolly pile of gold across the
<i>trente-et-quarante</i> table towards me, by
Jove.'
</p>

<p>
It did not occur to him that by little
speeches like this and anecdotes about his
own acumen in the betting ring, he let a
little light in upon the general tenor of
his past and present life, and, all
unconscious that Sir Paget and others listened
with slightly elevated eyebrows, he would
produce a sealskin cigar-case of portentous
dimensions, draw therefrom a great Rio
Hondo cigar, and after carefully manipulating
it, begin to smoke it with intense
satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
Hawke Holcroft, like Mr. Micawber,
was always waiting for something to 'turn
up' in the way of good for himself, and
now thought he had found that something
in Olive Raymond&mdash;an heiress free, he
deemed, to choose for herself&mdash;free to be
wooed and won; and on a day when she
proposed a riding-party to visit Macbeth's
Castle of Dunsinane he very nearly had
the hardihood to learn his fate&mdash;in the
words of Montrose's song, to put it 'to the
touch, to win or lose it all.'
</p>

<p>
Drives, riding-parties, and rambles to
visit artistic bits of scenery and the rural
[** Transcriber's note: line missing from source book?]
lions the neighbourhood afforded every
opportunity to those who wished to
cultivate each other's society at Dundargue,
and the expedition proposed by Olive to
visit the ruins of the usurper's castle,
proved the occasion of Mr. Hawke
Holcroft's attempt to advance his own interests.
</p>

<p>
Whatever Lady Aberfeldie's views were,
her husband had never been called upon
to fulfil the duties of a vigilant guardian
or parent, and to study the difference
between 'detrimentals' and married parties,
so he left the guidance of the whole affair
in the hands of Allan, and remained
closeted with his solicitor.
</p>

<p>
By judicious manoeuvring, Holcroft
contrived to pair-off with Olive, while Allan
thus became the escort of Ruby Logan,
and Eveline, of course, fell to Sir Paget,
who soon found the truth of the vulgar
adage about two being company, &amp;c., on
their being joined by Stratherroch.
</p>

<p>
It was a clear and brilliant day early in
October, when the blue sky was flecked
by fleecy clouds, and the far-stretching
scenery of the fertile Carse, overlooked
by the long chain of heights, named the
Sidlaw Hills, lay steeped in sunshine.
</p>

<p>
The parks of Dundargue, with their
broad acres of velvet-like turf, their stately
oaks and towering beeches, among the gnarled
branches of which legions of gleds were
cawing to each other, and brown squirrels
were gliding to and fro; their hedges of
ancient thorn, and others where the
hawthorn berries showed red and the wild
roses were blooming&mdash;the parks, we say,
were left behind, with all their groups of
deer, and the party, certainly a merry and
a well-mounted one, accompanied by the
stag-hounds Shiuloch and Bran, careering
joyously on either hand, followed by a
couple of splendidly-horsed grooms,
cantered along the highway, and ere long
broke, or fell, into that slow and ambling
pace which is suited for conversing with
ease.  And Holcroft, who was well versed
in all horsey details, and had a very
appreciative eye, could see that his fair
companion's <i>tout ensemble</i>, her riding
costume, her hat, veil, and gauntlets were
all perfect, from the coils of brown glossy
hair to the little foot that rested firmly in
its tiny stirrup of burnished steel; and
that foot was indeed a model&mdash;arched,
small, and always full of character in its
elasticity of tread; and, more than all,
intoxicated by the ambient air, the
sunshine, her own high spirits, and the
pleasure of being mounted on her own
favourite pad, Olive Raymond was looking
her brightest and her best.
</p>

<p>
He had, while engaging all her attention
in conversation, contrived, unknown to
her, by the pacing of his horse, to leave
the trio referred to at some distance
behind; while, luckily for him, Allan
Graham, lured on by Ruby Logan&mdash;who was
something between a flirt and a hoyden&mdash;had
gone ahead with her suddenly at a
hand-gallop, and now the pair were out of
sight.
</p>

<p>
There could be no engagement, despite
all rumour thereof&mdash;not even a passing
fancy&mdash;between the cousins, was now
Holcroft's conviction, and of his own
ultimate success with Olive he began to have
little doubt, could he but warily mould her
to his purpose; and already in fancy he
saw her thousands&mdash;how many there were
he knew not&mdash;firmly in his grasp.
</p>

<p>
Though swallowed up by mortgages,
his place in Essex&mdash;or the few acres that
nominally still remained to him there&mdash;caused
the retention of his name among
the 'landed gentry of England,' and he
based much upon that circumstance as
aiding his designs on Lord Aberfeldie's
ward, to whom he had sometimes dropped
glowing hints of possession that were not
nor ever had been his.
</p>

<p>
Something undefined in Olive's manner
rather encouraged him on this day.  She,
to show that she resented the apparent
indifference of Allan as being a 'laggard
in love,' even while resenting the tenor of
that family compact which was meant to
bind them together, was disposed to flirt
with Holcroft, out of pique rather than
precise preference, and to annoy Allan.
</p>

<p>
With the latter present now, Holcroft
became at times a species of difficulty to
Olive.  During a past season in London
there had been sundry, not exactly love-passages,
but little coquettings and lingerings
in conservatories that nearly amounted
to such; and he, in ignorance of the
footing in which she was regarded by the
family, was quite inclined, penniless as he
was, or nearly so, to revive, if not
improve, past relations; and this had been
his object from the first day he came to
Dundargue.
</p>

<p>
And now 'that muscular idiot the Master,'
as he was in the habit of mentally
calling Allan, having cantered out of sight,
he addressed himself more fully to his
companion and the matter in hand.
</p>

<p>
'I enjoy town to the full&mdash;none can do
so more&mdash;when I am there, but I love&mdash;oh,
I do love&mdash;the country!' replied Olive,
in reply to a remark of Holcroft's about
their last London season.
</p>

<p>
'It is always very romantic, of course,
and all that sort of thing.'
</p>

<p>
'And with pleasant people about one,
the country becomes so delightful for a
time; and then we girls have such perfect
freedom here.'
</p>

<p>
'Even an escort is not necessary at times.'
</p>

<p>
'Unless in the park&mdash;beyond that I
always like to have one,' said Olive.
</p>

<p>
'Are you pleased to have <i>me</i> for one?'
he asked, in a low voice, and pretty
pointedly.
</p>

<p>
'Of course,' she answered, frankly.
</p>

<p>
'How charming to be at hand in case
of danger!'
</p>

<p>
'What possible danger?' asked Olive,
with surprise.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, the untimely appearance of an
infuriated stag or the proverbial mad bull
of the three-volume novel.'
</p>

<p>
'Why not a brigand or a Bengal tiger?'
said Olive, laughing; then, suddenly
becoming grave, she added&mdash;'But, by the
way, talking of Bengal, please to give me
back my bangle.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Simply because I cannot permit you
to retain it,' she replied, little foreseeing
to what the natural request might lead.
</p>

<p>
'Do not deprive me of it!' he urged,
softly and entreatingly.
</p>

<p>
'Why?' asked she, in return; 'for what
reason.  It is impossible&mdash;what may
people say?'
</p>

<p>
'What they please, if seen, which it
never shall be.'
</p>

<p>
'What might they not think?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, what does it matter?' he urged
again, with much would-be sadness and
tenderness.
</p>

<p>
'Little to you, perhaps, but much to
me,' retorted Olive; 'but I do not choose
that aught should be either thought or said
about it.  We shall certainly be accused of
flirting.'
</p>

<p>
'No, no, Miss Raymond&mdash;oh, no,
Olive&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Olive!' she repeated, in a startled
manner.
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me&mdash;none could ever accuse
me of flirting with you&mdash;that were an
impossibility&mdash;for deeper thoughts&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'My bangle, please, Mr. Holcroft, and at
once!' she said, imperatively, in dread of
what more he might say.
</p>

<p>
She held forth her hand, but the trinket
either would not come off his wrist, or he
pretended that such was the case.  Olive
tried to remove it, but in vain, and
glanced round her, red with vexation.  Her
hand was gloved, otherwise she would
have felt how unpleasantly cold and
clammy were the fingers of her would-be
lover.
</p>

<p>
'Allow me to retain it, even for a
time&mdash;though would that I might wear it in
my grave&mdash;for a time, in memory of the
darling hopes I have dared to cherish,' he
whispered, in a manner there could be no
mistaking now.
</p>

<p>
'Spare me this melodramatic sort of
thing, Mr. Holcroft,' said Olive, growing
rather pale; 'I cannot&mdash;must not listen
to you.'
</p>

<p>
'Why&mdash;what do you mean?'
</p>

<p>
'That there are obstacles between us,
even were there not the want of liking,'
she replied, decidedly, but with an agitated
voice.
</p>

<p>
'Obstacles?' he repeated, inquiringly,
sadly, and certainly with an air of
<i>disappointment</i>; 'am I now to understand that
you are engaged to the Master of Aberfeldie,
as these absurd Scots people call him?'
</p>

<p>
Olive bit her ruddy nether lip at this
home question; but made no reply.
</p>

<p>
'What enigma is this?  You either are
or you are not.  If not, why may not I&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I dare not listen to this style of
conversation,' interrupted Olive, with positive
annoyance; 'and you have no right to
force it upon me.'
</p>

<p>
'After all that has passed?' said he,
reproachfully, and rather feeling as if his
hopes were melting into air.
</p>

<p>
'I do not understand you,' replied Olive,
whose conscience certainly did reproach
her.
</p>

<p>
'If I force this conversation&mdash;' he began
in a bitter and rather upbraiding tone,
then pausing; 'pardon me if I offend,' he
resumed, with what seemed growing sadness,
while attempting to touch her hand,
yet withdrawing his own in apparent
timidity.  'But am I wrong in deeming your
engagement&mdash;or alleged engagement, as
rumour says, made when you were a child&mdash;one
in which your woman's heart and
wishes have not been consulted?  Tell
me&mdash;for I may have to leave Dundargue soon
now.'
</p>

<p>
She was in some respects but a weak
girl; he a crafty and wily man of the
world; and, though he knew it not in the
least, he was touching her on a very
tender point&mdash;yet she replied, firmly enough,
</p>

<p>
'You have no right to question me; but
say, what has Allan done to you that your
face should darken at the mention of his
name?  Is he not your friend?'
</p>

<p>
'He was.'
</p>

<p>
'And now&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'He is no longer so.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'He is my rival.'
</p>

<p>
She coloured to her temples at this
blunt reply, and all it inferred.
</p>

<p>
'I loved you long before you ever cared
for me,' he resumed, coolly.
</p>

<p>
'Sir&mdash;how dare you say I ever cared for
you?' exclaimed Olive, her cheeks aflame
now; 'let this subject cease, and be
resumed no more!'
</p>

<p>
'It breaks my heart to hear you speak
thus.'
</p>

<p>
'Hearts don't break now-a-days, even in
such romantic places as Dundargue,' said
she, with a sharp little laugh; 'and here
this matter ends.'
</p>

<p>
He bowed in silence; but, fatally
perhaps for Allan's interests and her own, she
thought, and her vanity was flattered by
the idea:
</p>

<p>
'Holcroft loves me, despite the tenor of
papa's will&mdash;loves me, for myself, of
course; while Allan <i>knows</i> its value to
himself!  Surely there is a difference in
this!'
</p>

<p>
But it was precisely because Holcroft
knew neither of the will nor its spirit that
he took the courage to address her as he
did.  Had he done so, that enterprising
gentleman would speedily have 'dropped
out of the hunt,' and, so far as he is
concerned, we should then have no story to tell.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile he did not lose heart, and
thought he had only to wait the fulness of
time for the certainty of winning her, and
with her, wealth&mdash;of joy or happiness he
took no heed at all.
</p>

<p>
By this time, greatly to Olive's relief,
Eveline and her two swains had overtaken
them, and so the matter dropped, though
the minds of both, from two points of
view, were full of it.  She would now
have to endure the double annoyance of
being daily in the society of a lover who
had addressed her as such, and of an
<i>intended</i> lover who had scarcely yet
approached the subject!
</p>

<p>
And, for some reason only known to
herself, she did not tell Eveline, though her
bosom-friend, of what had passed between
herself and Holcroft.  The latter,
however, still retained the golden bangle on
which her name was engraved; but for a
time now there was something in her
manner little to the liking of Hawke
Holcroft&mdash;full as he was of dreams of her, or
of her fortune rather&mdash;of the risks he ran,
and the shifts to which he might be put
ere he handled it.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
THE PICNIC AT DUNSINANE.
</h3>

<p>
Ambling on together and urging their
horses, but at an easy pace, they soon
drew near the object of their destination&mdash;Macbeth's
famous castle of Dunsinane&mdash;whither
the portly old butler, Mr. Tappleton,
had preceded them in a wagonette,
freighted with a luxurious luncheon; and,
leaving their cattle in charge of the grooms,
they began the ascent of that peak of the
Sidlaw Hills which has been immortalised
by Shakespeare.
</p>

<p>
With her riding-skirt thrown over her
left arm, Eveline acted as their guide, and
it may easily be supposed that she solicited
the assistance of Cameron's arm, rather
than that of Sir Paget Puddicombe, who
had quite enough to do in assisting himself
up a path which proved to him, as he said,
'rather a breather.'
</p>

<p>
It was a winding road cut in the rock,
all the other sides being steep and difficult
of access, and ere long, on reaching the
flat and fertile summit, which commands a
magnificent view of Strathmore and
Blairgowrie, they found themselves within the
strong rampart and deep fosse of what has
once been a great military station of oval
form, two hundred and ten feet long, by
one hundred and thirty broad; and there
they found Allan and Ruby Logan, who
had preceded them, in full possession of
the highest point, whence he was directing
her attention to the chief features in the
scenery, including, of course, Birnam
Wood, fifteen miles distant, 'The Lang
Man's Grave,' a great stone, under which
Macbeth is said to lie&mdash;Ruby the while
clinging to his arm in the exuberance of
her delight, and carrying her riding-hat
in her hand, as she was quite aware that
her hair alone, in its wonderful luxuriance,
made her very attractive, it being an
unruly mass of rich, rippling golden amber in
hue, shot with a redder and brighter tint
at times when the sunlight struck it.
</p>

<p>
Under the splendour of a glorious noon,
while a soft breeze rippled the verdant
grass, the luncheon was proceeded with;
fowls were dissected, pies investigated,
champagne and hock, cool from the ice-pails,
uncorked; all the requisites for a
merry party were there, and yet in the
party itself the chief element of high
spirits was wanting, unless in the instance
of Ruby Logan, who began to flatter
herself that she had made&mdash;or nearly so&mdash;a
conquest of the Master of Aberfeldie.
</p>

<p>
Oppressed with the tenor of the
conversation that had so recently passed
between herself and Mr. Holcroft, Olive
Raymond was unusually silent, and, for
her, <i>distraite</i>; and he, remembering the
somewhat decided 'snub' she had so
unexpectedly given him, was somewhat silent
too, but sought consolation in champagne,
while listening rather abstractedly to Sir
Paget Puddicombe descanting on the
traditions of the neighbourhood, as, in
guide-book fashion, he knew all about the
predictions of the weird sisters, the defeat
and death of the usurper, and was full of
the probability that the great dramatist
had visited Dunsinane in person.
</p>

<p>
But Holcroft only quaffed his liquor,
tugged his tawny moustache from time to
time, and listened with an air of boredom,
mingled with a quizzical expression of
mistrust in his pale grey shifty eyes.
</p>

<p>
He had seen Macbeth on the stage, of
course, and endured him more than once;
but of the Thane of Cawdor he knew no
more than what he had seen of him behind
the footlights, and had cared to learn no
more; and now it was with some genuine
Cockney bewilderment, as he looked at
the massive trenches around him, he began
to think that 'some such fellow had existed
then.'
</p>

<p>
Eveline and young Cameron, under Sir
Paget's eye, were both reserved and <i>triste</i>,
and no wine seemed capable of rousing
animation in the lover.  He had but one
thought&mdash;the end of his leave was
approaching, and when he left Dundargue
he might never again see Eveline Graham.
His heart was heavy.
</p>

<p>
When the trio were riding together, it
was not that the eyes of Eveline
disappointed him, or that she did not converse
with him fully and earnestly; but he had
detected in the manner of Sir Paget a
provoking air of proprietary and confidence
with regard to her that keenly piqued him,
and could only have been born, he rightly
conjectured, of some recent confidential
arrangement with Lord Aberfeldie; but
the young girl herself was sweetly
unconscious of it all.
</p>

<p>
His responses had been brief, and he
had ventured on few remarks, aware that
little would escape unnoticed; thus he had
been somewhat silent, while Sir Paget's
easy-going old roadster ambled between
the horses of himself and Eveline, going
pace for pace, Sir Paget's head at each
jerking forward in turtle fashion.
</p>

<p>
The trio still remained together when
seated on the grass at luncheon, for
neither of the gentlemen were disposed
to quit the side of Eveline, whose colour
might have been noticed to heighten at
a question Sir Paget asked Cameron, of
whom he certainly had a certain jealousy.
</p>

<p>
'Where does your property of Stratherroch
lie, Mr. Cameron?'
</p>

<p>
'In Inverness-shire.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah!&mdash;mountainous, of course&mdash;good
shooting for those who care for such
things&mdash;not that I do.  Is the land very
remunerative now?'
</p>

<p>
'To others&mdash;not to me,' said Cameron,
a little bitterly.  'A fair inheritance would
be mine, Sir Paget, were Stratherroch
unencumbered.  My father was a wild
fellow in his day&mdash;as what Highland laird
is not?  How some acres were mortgaged
in succession, how others went <i>in toto</i>,
heaven only knows&mdash;I don't.  The estate
is at nurse now; one day it will be mine
again&mdash;but not for years; and I was too
long foolishly sentimental about it.'
</p>

<p>
'How?' asked Sir Paget.
</p>

<p>
'I thought I would rather that the
manor-house fell to ruins than pass, even
temporarily, into the possession of
strangers&mdash;of others than a Cameron; and now, by
Jove! it has been for years occupied by
one Jones Smithson, of Manchester.'
</p>

<p>
'Whose rental is clearing it?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; and meantime I have little more
in this world than my claymore and
commission in the Black Watch,' said Cameron,
with a somewhat hollow laugh and a swift,
sad glance at Eveline; while Sir Paget
smiled complacently as he thought of the
balance at <i>his</i> bankers, and the fat,
unfettered acres that lay round Slough-cum-Sloggit.
</p>

<p>
'I hope you do not find Dundargue dull,
Sir Paget?' said Eveline, to change a
conversation that rather oppressed her, as she
was sharp enough to divine the thoughts
of both men.
</p>

<p>
'Assuredly not, Miss Graham; how
could it be so when I am enabled to renew
my intimacy with one who can cast, as it
were, bright sunshine in the most shady
place?' he replied, with an unusual jerk of
his head, a glance of eye, and accentuation
of voice that annoyed her greatly, while
Cameron's lip quivered under his moustache
with mingled irritation and amusement.
</p>

<p>
And now at luncheon, inspired by a few
bumpers of Clicquot, Sir Paget's glances at
Eveline took occasionally the fashion of
grotesque and languishing leers.
</p>

<p>
The wealthy baronet was older than she
by a great many years, but they by no
means warranted him being safe from a
love, or passion rather, that might prove
cruel as the grave&mdash;the passion of a
middle-aged man for a very handsome young girl,
whose parents were fully disposed to
further his views and their own.  It has been
said that 'people for the life of them
cannot be said to believe in the love pangs
of a man over forty, or of a woman over
twenty-nine,' but people may at times be
wrong.
</p>

<p>
The present epoch was rather a trying
one to Cameron and Eveline.  As she had
admitted to Allan, she knew that he loved
her with a love unselfish and unspoken;
and he felt intuitively that he was far from
indifferent to her&mdash;knew it by the
indescribable, untaught, and nameless signs by
which a man learns instinctively that a
woman loves him&mdash;in a first passion, a
most intoxicating conviction; yet
circumstances blended the happiness of Cameron
with much that was alloy.
</p>

<p>
To avoid attentions or would-be tender
speeches that might annoy poor Cameron,
Eveline found herself compelled to talk
intently to Sir Paget about local traditions
and superstitions, and, thanks to her old
nurse Nannie, she had&mdash;for a fashionable
young lady of the present day&mdash;a curious
<i>répertoire</i> of stories about wraiths and
warnings, <i>Daione Shi</i> and other fairies,
who were wont in pre-railway times to
haunt the corries, cairns, and rocks.
</p>

<p>
'Have you no ghosts in or about
Dundargue?' asked Sir Paget.  'A grand old
mansion is scarcely complete without some
such spectral visitor.'
</p>

<p>
'Surely that oubliette, whatever it is, of
which I have heard more than once, must
contain something of the kind?' said Holcroft,
in a covert, but detestable kind of
sneering tone, which he could adopt when
his own interests were not concerned.
</p>

<p>
'In the gallery that leads to it I have
heard of something strange,' said Allan.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, do tell us&mdash;what is seen there?'
exclaimed Ruby Logan.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing&mdash;but old servants have a story
to the effect that if anyone remains long
there,' replied Allan, laughing, 'they are
certain to have a strong sense of shadowy
forms&mdash;intangible presences&mdash;hovering
near them, and dare not turn their heads
to see what they are.'
</p>

<p>
'We have no decided ghosts, thank
Heaven!' said Eveline, laughing, and all
unconscious of Holcroft's manner.  'There
are none even in the palaces of Holyrood
or Falkland, where terrible things have
been done, so why should there be in poor
old Dundargue?  But a spot close by
where we are now lunching is the alleged
scene of a curious event&mdash;a very dark
tradition in our family history.'
</p>

<p>
'Why recur to a story so absurd?' said
Allan.
</p>

<p>
But she was pressed to explain herself,
and with a shy, sweet smile in her eyes
as she glanced from time to time at Evan
Cameron, and a wonderfully musical modulation
of voice, she told her tale, but not
quite as old nurse Nannie had told it to
her.
</p>

<p>
'The deep, rocky dell that lies between
this and Dundargue, a few miles distant,
was ever in past times what we find it
now, covered with dense forest-trees,
mingled with alders and silver birches so
thickly as to exclude the rays of the sun, and
it was said to be the haunt of a Urisk or
mountain-goblin&mdash;a species of fiend which,
Sir Walter Scott says, tradition avers to
have had a figure half-man and half-goat.'
</p>

<p>
'In short, the Grecian satyr of classical
antiquity,' said Allan, laughing.
</p>

<p>
'Be that as it may, the existence of this
particular Urisk was never fairly proved
until the days of one of our ancestors,
Malise Graham of Dundargue, who fought
at the battle of Ben Rinnes against the
Reformers, and had in hiding in the
"Priest's Hole," as it is still called, in
the keep, a wandering Scottish Benedictine,
known only as James of Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
'Now, Malise Graham had an only
daughter, Muriel, a girl possessed of that
rare and soft beauty&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Which is still the inheritance of her
family,' said Sir Paget, with a most
portentous jerk of his head.
</p>

<p>
'Please not to interrupt me, or I shall
stop,' exclaimed Eveline, with unconcealed
annoyance.  'Muriel, in her walks near
Dundargue, had made&mdash;unknown to her
family&mdash;the acquaintance of a handsome
young stranger of winning manners and
prepossessing appearance.
</p>

<p>
'In the secluded life led in those days
by a maiden of rank, such an event was
of deep and peculiar interest; love
speedily became the sequel, and in truth the
object of it seemed to have been a very
loveable fellow.  Thus it was, with many
bitter tears, that one evening she told him
that her frequent absence from home had
been remarked, and that she must meet
him no more in that wooded hollow, especially
as it was the haunt of goblins and
other evil spirits.
</p>

<p>
'On hearing this, the handsome stranger
laughed till all the dell seemed to re-echo,
caressed her tenderly, and, after urging her
on peril of her truth and soul to come
to the trysting-place at least once again,
left her in haste, as some one was seen to
approach them.
</p>

<p>
'This proved to be James of Jerusalem,
who is still remembered as the Black
Priest of Dundargue.  He wore nothing
that was canonical; to have done so
would have been as much as his life was
worth in those days; thus he was clad in
a sable Geneva cloak and doublet, with
falling bands, and a calotte cap of black
velvet with long lappets.
</p>

<p>
'He looked deadly pale, and was trembling
in every limb, while he crossed himself
again and again, and said, in a low and
agitated voice,
</p>

<p>
'"Child Muriel, who is he that left you
in such hot haste just now?"
</p>

<p>
'But Muriel,
</p>

<p>
  "Crimson with shame, with terror mute,"<br />
</p>

<p>
terror of her father, who was a stern and
rigid man, remained silent.
</p>

<p>
'"Speak, unhappy girl!" urged the priest.
</p>

<p>
'"I know not his name," she replied, faintly.
</p>

<p>
'"Why?"
</p>

<p>
'"He conceals it from me."
</p>

<p>
'"And why?"
</p>

<p>
'"I know not; but oh, father, guide and
counsel me, for I love him dearly, as he
loves me."
</p>

<p>
'"You must meet him&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'"Once again," she urged, piteously.
</p>

<p>
'"Never more, I meant to say&mdash;never
more.  But why say you once again?"
</p>

<p>
'"I have promised, on my soul's peril."
</p>

<p>
'"On your soul's peril indeed!" groaned
the priest, in great tribulation; but, in
defiance of all he could urge, Muriel,
though she lived in an age of dark
superstition, of omens and dread, inspired by
her love, stole forth at the usual hour and
entered the dell to meet her lover, for the
last time, as it proved.
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps it was a prevision of this that
made the wood seem so dark and gloomy,
and even the knots and gnarled branches
of the trees to look like those in the forest
to Undine, fiendish faces and freakish
limbs.
</p>

<p>
'Muriel knew in her heart that such
meetings were wrong, unbecoming to her
position, and sinful because she concealed
them; but a spell seemed upon her, and
she could not resist it.  She took no heed
of the future; she had but one thought, to
be again with him.
</p>

<p>
'"And oh! why should this meeting be
our last one?" she wailed in her heart,
as he drew her to him, looking so
handsome the while in his black doublet
slashed with red, his ruff and scarlet plume.
</p>

<p>
'"My own!" said he, caressingly; "my
own, I am aware that yonder dotard, fool
and knave, the mass-monger, has been
seeking to influence your mind against me,
and to part us."
</p>

<p>
'"And here he stands prepared to do
so!" exclaimed the black priest, as he
suddenly appeared beside them, his eyes
sparkling, but strangely with fear, rage, and
triumph mingling in their expression.
Muriel's lover clasped her to his breast,
and wrapped his scarlet mantle round her.
Then, while his eyes glared with a fire
which fortunately she did not see, he
exclaimed,
</p>

<p>
'"Stand back, canting liar&mdash;stand back,
and begone!"
</p>

<p>
'"Child Muriel, come to me, in the
name of God!" cried the priest, in sore
agony; but she still clung to her lover, who,
at the name uttered, cowered and shrank,
as in the opera we see Mephistopheles
cower and shrink before the cross-hilted
swords of the soldiers.
</p>

<p>
'"Muriel, Muriel, you are mine!"
exclaimed her lover, attempting to lift her
from the ground.
</p>

<p>
'"Take heed, child, ere it is too late,"
urged the priest.
</p>

<p>
'"Dare you advise?" asked the stranger,
mockingly; "does not one day judge
another?"
</p>

<p>
'"Yes, and the last day judges all&mdash;even
such as you!" cried the benedictine; then,
making a sign of the cross in the air, he
exclaimed, 'In nomine Patris et Filii; et
Spiritus Sancti!'
</p>

<p>
'Scarcely had he done so when, under
the power of his exorcism, the mantle,
ruff, and plume of the pretended knight
turned to bracken leaves, his goblin chain
to wild holly, and he stood forth in all his
deformity, a horror to the eye, half man
and half goat, with the face of a baffled
and exasperated fiend&mdash;the Urisk, or wood
goblin; and, with a malignant yell, he
vanished down the fast-darkening dingle!'
</p>

<p>
'And Muriel?' asked Holcroft, who had
listened to all with such a smile as his face
might be expected to wear.
</p>

<p>
'Was saved, of course,' said Eveline.
</p>

<p>
'And lived happy ever after?'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;content at least, let us hope.
She died a nun in the house of the English
Benedictines at Paris&mdash;now the convent of
the Val de Grace.'
</p>

<p>
'And has this legend a moral?' asked
Holcroft, mockingly.
</p>

<p>
'Of course it has,' answered Allan, rather
bluntly, yet with a quiet smile; 'it gave a
good hint to the girls at Dundargue to
beware of the attentions of unaccredited
strangers.'
</p>

<p>
Holcroft's colour changed for a moment,
and not unnoticed by Allan; for perhaps,
reading between the lines, all this seemed
somewhat a parable to the former, who
tugged at his yellow moustaches in a way
he did when irritated, heedless that pomade
hongroise was disastrous to straw-coloured
gloves.
</p>

<p>
The angry gleam that crossed the eyes
of Holcroft was also noticed by Evan
Cameron, who, for some reason as yet
only known to himself, could not abide
him; though certainly the latter did not
cross <i>him</i> by any attentions to the
penniless Eveline Graham.
</p>

<p>
Her little tradition came as a pleasant
interlude to nearly all, for save Sir
Paget&mdash;always confident and genial&mdash;no one
seemed quite at ease, as a sense of
cross-purposes brooded over them.
</p>

<p>
'Tappleton,' cried Allan to the butler,
'another glass of champagne all round;
and then to be off,' he added, swinging
Olive adroitly into her saddle, and thus,
as he thought, anticipating Holcroft,
though the latter, remembering keenly
his recent 'snub,' had no intention of
offering his services just then.
</p>

<p>
Allan, fearing that he had gone rather
too far with Ruby Logan in attempting to
pique his cousin, now resolved to leave
that young lady to the care of anyone else
in their homeward ride, much to her
surprise and disappointment, and took his
place by the side of Olive, in obedience to
a half-inviting glance she gave him.
</p>

<p>
He and his sister were, of course, familiar
since childhood with the ruins of Dunsinane
and all their surroundings; but to two
or three of the party, as they turned to
depart, and saw the vast ramparts
reddened by the setting sun, there came to
memory the scene they had so often
witnessed on the stage&mdash;Malcolm's army with
the boughs of Birnam in their helmets,
the 'alarms and excursions,' the fierce
and protracted melo-dramatic combat, the
downfall of Macbeth beneath the sword
of Macduff, and the cries of 'Hail, King
of Scotland&mdash;King of Scotland, hail!'

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
THE GOLDEN BANGLE.
</h3>

<p>
A writer says 'there is the beauty of
youth, and surely there is the beauty of
love, too,' and the latter certainly shone in
the soft eyes of Eveline Graham as she
caracoled her horse in the homeward ride
by the side of young Cameron, and her
eyes, which were ever the mystery of that
face, had now their sweetest smiles for
him.  She saw how his face was lighted
up, and was aware how his voice softened
when he addressed her as it softened to
no other woman; and yet, withal, though
no word of love had passed between these
two, right well did they know the secret
of each other's hearts; but poverty
fettered his tongue, and her parents'
ambition and known wishes nearly repressed all
hope in the heart of Eveline.
</p>

<p>
With all her regard for her father she
had a fear of him, and still more so of her
mother.  All their prejudices were in
favour of wealth; but Evan Cameron
appeared to her altogether so dear and
irresistible that she, poor girl, could not
imagine anyone being proof against him, and
with this conviction, and the knowledge
that Allan loved him, she permitted herself
occasionally to live in a kind of fool's
paradise, wherein Sir Paget Puddicombe
had no part.
</p>

<p>
When her mother was not present, she
played to Evan Cameron, and sang his
favourite songs; she showed him her
drawings for hints and suggestions,
discussed her favourite books, and let him
hang over her chair; and at such times,
though nothing of love was said, there
was a subtle tenderness in Cameron's eye
and voice that made her impulsive heart
quicken, as no man's eye or voice had ever
done before, and young though she was,
Eveline had heard more than one
declaration of love.
</p>

<p>
And now for a time he had the joy of
having her all to himself, as they
contrived to distance the rest of their party.
</p>

<p>
But what availed it?  Evan knew that,
if once he passed beyond what appeared
to be the merest friendship, his visit to
Dundargue might come to a speedy end,
and its hospitality could never be extended
to him again.
</p>

<p>
To Evan, Eveline Graham proved, if
we may say so, a kind of revelation after
the rough life he had led of late years in
India&mdash;something from another world, as
it were&mdash;and thus much of adoration mingled
with his love for her.  If dying could
have served Eveline, there and then would
Evan Cameron have died for her!
</p>

<p>
Whether such enthusiastic passion
might last it was impossible to say, but
time may show.
</p>

<p>
We have referred to the quiet confidence
of Sir Paget Puddicombe&mdash;a confidence
borne of his consciousness of wealth and
assured position.  However, he was sharp
enough to see to some extent how Cameron
was attracted by Eveline, and to feel
how the latter preferred the young subaltern's
society to his own; but in a very
short time he knew that the 'detrimental,'
as Lady Aberfeldie called him, would be
again with his regiment, the Black Watch,
perhaps under orders for foreign service;
then he would have the course all to
himself, and doubted not, as Holcroft would
have said, 'to win in a canter.'
</p>

<p>
Cameron thought the proverb right
about there being no fool like an old one;
but then, every old fool had not Sir Paget's
bank-book, and the preference and influence
of parents to back up his folly.  But
with a handsome figure, and his V.C., how
much more was Cameron like the object of
a young girl's eye than Sir Paget could
ever be!
</p>

<p>
'It was in the Kurram Pass, in Afghanistan,
that you gained the Victoria Cross,
Mr. Cameron?' said Eveline, breaking a
pause in the conversation, and shortening
her reins, while he checked the pace of
his horse, and replied, with a pleased
smile,
</p>

<p>
'Yes; but how do you know that, Miss
Graham&mdash;from your brother, the Master?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'I have never spoken of it.'
</p>

<p>
'I read it in the Army List,' replied
Eveline, candidly, and to hear her say so
made the bronze cross of more value to
him than the Garter would have been.
</p>

<p>
She had read it, and committed the
episode to heart too&mdash;how 'the Queen had
been graciously pleased to signify her
intention of conferring the decoration of the
Victoria Cross' on Lieutenant Evan
Cameron, of the &mdash;th Foot, and now of the
Black Watch, for a daring act of bravery
on a date given, when the retreating forces
were attacked by Afghans in great
strength, the latter having pushed forward
upon the position at daybreak, and
Lieutenant Cameron, accompanied by only five
soldiers, captured a nine-pounder gun,
shooting down or bayonetting all the
gunners, and thus preventing the destructive
use of the piece, which he brought off with
the loss of one man, but in the conflict
received three severe tulwar wounds.
</p>

<p>
Cameron was an enthusiast in his profession,
and with outwardly the air of a
well-bred man of the world, and thoroughly
so that of a young Line officer, he had in
his nature a deep sentiment of nationality,
of clanship, and Highland romance, with
an intense pride in his regiment.  He had
entertained Eveline often with sketches,
anecdotes, and traditions of the Black
Watch, but of himself and his V.C., of
course, he never spoke.
</p>

<p>
'What a proud moment it must have
been for you, when you knew that you had
won the cross!' said the girl, with a flush
on her soft cheek.
</p>

<p>
Stirred in his soul by the interest she
took in him, the great secret of his heart
was trembling on his lips, but he repressed
it, and a shadow came into his face and a
wistfulness into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Prouder would I have been, Miss
Graham,' said he, 'if&mdash;if&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'What?'
</p>

<p>
'I had then been known even by name
to <i>you</i>?' he replied, in a low voice, and
with a manner there was no mistaking.
</p>

<p>
Nothing more was said then; yet they
both felt, while eye met eye, that their
first words of love had been spoken.
</p>

<p>
More might, perhaps, have passed, as
the subject could easily have been enlarged
on; but just then they were abruptly
joined by Allan, who came up at a trot and
reined in his horse sharply by their side,
with a dark expression on his face, which
Eveline thought augured ill for his success
with Olive, whom he had suddenly left in
the care of Mr. Hawke Holcroft.
</p>

<p>
After quitting the ruins, as Allan rode
on by his cousin's side, his memory had
gone back to the days when she was a girl
of some twelve years or so&mdash;a bright-eyed
hoyden, who could fish, even take a shot
from his gun, climb trees, eat apples right
off the branch, play marbles with him,
grasp a trout darting in the burn under
the long yellow broom or purple brambles,
and was his companion in many a ramble
and out-door frolic; and now inspired by
that memory, the scenery and beauty of
the evening, he felt himself disposed to
treat with considerable tenderness the
lovely girl he hoped to make yet his own.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Olive cared little to
please him, and for a time she almost
repelled, and yet by doing so she greatly
lured and attracted him.
</p>

<p>
The friendship of Allan and Olive was a
source of some perplexity, if not amusement,
to Eveline Graham, but of irritation
to her mother, to whom they never seemed
to act as lovers at all, unless in 'the Scots
fashion' of pouting and quarrelling.
</p>

<p>
To the eyes of all interested in the matter,
it did not seem that she cared for him
in the least.  She never altered a plan or
hastened her pace to meet him, or go where
he might chance to be&mdash;in the library, on
the terrace smoking, or in any of the
quaint corridors that traversed the old
house.  She never adopted a dress, a
ribbon, or ornament to please his eye,
though she sometimes did, coquettishly,
he thought, to flatter Hawke Holcroft;
and even now, as they were slowly
traversing the dark, woody dell of the
legend&mdash;the <i>Coire-nan-Uriskin</i>&mdash;she was humming,
half in warning, half in waggery, Tennyson's song:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'She can both false and friendly be,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beware! beware!<br />
  Trust her not, she is fooling thee!'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And yet, as she glanced at her soldierly
cousin from time to time under her long,
dark lashes, she thought that, though he
looked stately in the kilt, he seldom looked
better than now when in riding costume,
with the smartest of light grey cover coats.
</p>

<p>
The girl's mind vibrated curiously between
her over-sensitive pride, her wishes,
her doubts, and half convictions.
</p>

<p>
If pique at her position in the family
with Allan had made her accept, with a
certain degree of equanimity, the attentions
of Holcroft, she now began to feel a
pleasure that she had not more fully
encouraged them.
</p>

<p>
At such moments as the present Allan
felt that this fair girl, who had ever been
his friend&mdash;cherished as a sister&mdash;this
sweet cousin with the violet eyes and rich
brown hair&mdash;was dear to him with a
tenderness to which he could scarcely give a
name, unless it were purest love; and she
might have read it in his eyes, intense and
strong, but for that spirit of wilfulness
which led her to temporise&mdash;was it to
tyrannise?&mdash;or play with it and him.
</p>

<p>
But may a girl really love a man till she
is certain of being loved in return?  For
Allan, baffled by her manner, had said
nothing very pointed as yet, as if he based
all their future on her father's will; and
times there were when in pique he dropped
his way of treating her half playfully, half
deferentially, and became absolutely cold.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the thoughts of Olive, apart
from her jealous pride, were somewhat
difficult to analyse; but, as yet, she
deemed that she could only regard him
with a kind of sisterly attention; while he,
when not irritated by the presence of
Holcroft, would say to Eveline,
</p>

<p>
'When we are alone, and can slip back
into our old memories, I shall soon teach
her to love me.'
</p>

<p>
'But meantime,' replied his sister, 'you
are the most tiresome couple in the
world.'
</p>

<p>
'I wish Mr. Holcroft or some one else
would join us,' said Olive, looking round
in her saddle.
</p>

<p>
'Why, it is always Mr. Holcroft!' exclaimed Allan.
</p>

<p>
'You are so provokingly silent.  For
more than a mile you have not once
spoken to me.  It is stupid to be so <i>triste</i>!
Surely there is some one else whose society
you prefer, or with whom you would be
more lively?'
</p>

<p>
'Olive!' said he, on hearing this blunt
and pointed remark&mdash;both curiously so for
her.  'You are surely not jealous of
anyone?' he added.
</p>

<p>
'Jealous!' echoed the girl, with a strange
but affected kind of lazy scorn; 'why
should I be so, and of <i>whom</i>?'
</p>

<p>
'Well may you ask, of whom could you
be so?' replied Allan, pointedly&mdash;so much
so that she coloured; 'though I, of course,
matter little to you.'
</p>

<p>
'Allan, you are very wrong to say so,'
said the girl, softly.
</p>

<p>
'Then I am not quite indifferent to
you?' urged Allan, impulsively now; 'you
do care for me a little?'
</p>

<p>
'Certainly&mdash;a good deal, if it is any
satisfaction to you; but there&mdash;don't touch
my bridle hand, or you will make my horse
shy.  How can you be so tiresome!'
</p>

<p>
Allan sighed, and yet he regarded her,
in her loveliness and insouciance, with an
expression just then of mingled amusement,
annoyance, and regard in his dark
hazel eyes.
</p>

<p>
With all the love that had been growing
in his heart for Olive, he had been in no
hurry to urge his suit, for, though
impetuous by nature, he could be reserved and
cautious enough at times; but now his
heart flew to his head, and he said,
bluntly,
</p>

<p>
'Dearest Olive, will you promise to love
me&mdash;to marry me?'
</p>

<p>
'Why require any promise about the
matter?' she replied, as all her wilfulness
returned; 'has not my father promised for
me&mdash;bequeathed me to you like a bale of
goods, or condemned me to poverty!' she
added, with a bitter laugh on her lips that
curled with anger.  'I wonder that he did
not order that I was to be locked up and
fed on bread and water till I gave my
consent to marry you, or that I was to be
dropped into that oubliette which exists
somewhere in Dundargue.'
</p>

<p>
'Cousin Olive,' said he, reproachfully,
'why this pride and doubt of my purpose?
You are as cruel as you are beautiful.'
</p>

<p>
'This is worse than anything you have
ever said to me,' she cried, with angry
laughter still.
</p>

<p>
'Worse?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, an attempt at gross straightforward
compliment, as if I was a girl at a
railway buffet.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't you like to be complimented?'
</p>

<p>
'By some people&mdash;yes,' was the petulant
reply.
</p>

<p>
'All the girls I have ever known have
liked pretty, flattering speeches.'
</p>

<p>
'But I am different, I hope, from most
of the girls you have known.'
</p>

<p>
'By Jove you are!' replied the Master,
twisting his moustache till he made himself
wince; 'but will I never be more to
you than I am now?'
</p>

<p>
'Never more than my cousin&mdash;what
would you desire to be?  But here comes
Mr. Holcroft, to whom I certainly made
no sign,' she added, with some annoyance,
as she thought of what had so lately passed
between them; and then, so variable was
her emotion, that she laughed as she
thought&mdash;'Two proposals in one day, and
both made in the saddle too&mdash;how droll!'
</p>

<p>
Allan misinterpreted her silent laugh as
a welcome to Holcroft, and shrank from
his own angry fears&mdash;they were not
convictions yet&mdash;lest he should adopt that
meanest passion of the whole category&mdash;jealousy
without a just cause&mdash;jealousy
of one inferior to him in social position,
and certainly in personal attractions.
</p>

<p>
When reduced to act cavalier to Miss
Ruby Logan, who certainly did not want
him, Hawke Holcroft had looked darkly
after the cousins as they rode off together,
and thought that nothing short of death
would prevent him from accomplishing
the object he had now in view ere he left
Dundargue.
</p>

<p>
From something in the manner of the
cousins, he&mdash;a close observer&mdash;augured
that Allan had not made his 'innings'
with the heiress, yet he cantered up to
Allan's side, and said, smilingly to Olive,
</p>

<p>
'May I smoke, Miss Raymond?  The
road is quite lonely, and if not disagreeable
to you&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Certainly,' said she, curtly.
</p>

<p>
'And I shall join you,' added Allan.
'Can you oblige me with a light, Holcroft?'
</p>

<p>
Cigars were selected, and Holcroft
handed his silver matchbox to Allan, who,
with a leap of his heart, though without
changing colour or a muscle of his dark and
sunburned face, saw on his rival's wrist
his own gift sent from Delhi, the gold
bangle, which Olive had, perhaps, for the
time forgotten, and on which was her own
name in raised Roman letters.
</p>

<p>
He had seen Holcroft in rather close
proximity to her during the most of the
day, and if piqued thereat, more than ever
was he piqued and startled now, and
abruptly wheeling round his horse, he
muttered some excuse and joined his sister
and his friend Cameron, while the words
of the song came ominously back to
memory&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Trust her not, she is fooling thee.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The bangle!  He blushed to think of it,
and shrank as yet from speaking of it,
even to Eveline, for he was altogether
unaware of under what circumstances
Holcroft came to possess it, or the effort
Olive had made to procure its return
without success, but imagination and
jealousy now did much to fill his heart
with secret fury.
</p>

<p>
Would the future hold love or hatred
for these two cousins?  It seemed just
then difficult to say.
</p>

<p>
Like Eveline, he thought the gift of the
photo a trifle when compared with this, yet
the photo was eventually to prove the
most serious and troublesome gift of the
two.
</p>

<p>
Wounded self-esteem, disquiet, and
intense mortification reigned supreme in the
mind of the somewhat proud young Master
of Aberfeldie; but he felt himself
necessitated to dissemble.  Hawke Holcroft was
his father's guest, the son of his father's
oldest and most valued friend; and while
at Dundargue it would be necessary to
treat him with courtesy, though Allan
never doubted that he was a 'leg,' and
resolved that his courtesy would be
blended with watchfulness, if&mdash;bitter
thought&mdash;Olive was now worth watching over!
</p>

<p>
Unprepared for such a crisis or catastrophe
as the discovery of the bangle, and
ignorant that Allan had made it, when a
carpet-dance took place that evening at
Dundargue, though Olive was arrayed in
one of her most becoming toilettes for
him, and him alone, he never even
addressed her or looked near her; and, black
though his brow, he entirely occupied
himself with Ruby Logan; and, provoked by
this, Olive again endured the attention of
Holcroft, and thought to play&mdash;or affect to
play&mdash;with them <i>both</i>.
</p>

<p>
In this, however, the little scheme was
doomed to be disappointed by the
events of the following day.
</p>

<p>
'I shall quit Dundargue for London, or
give up my leave and go back to the
regiment, and never look upon her fair, false
face again till I have schooled myself into
merely regarding her with a brotherly&mdash;well,
say cousinly&mdash;eye!' thought Allan,
with great bitterness of spirit.
</p>

<p>
But how about that absurd will and the
settlement of the money?
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
EVELINE'S SUITOR.
</h3>

<p>
'Verily,' says a writer, 'we miss our
opportunities, and live our lives as if they
were all to come twice over; not as if each
passing sunset brought us nearer that
day when the pulse must cease to beat,
and the heart with all its emotions must be
stilled for ever.'
</p>

<p>
Olive was now experiencing the truth of
this to a certain extent.
</p>

<p>
She had been&mdash;in spite of herself&mdash;touched
by Allan's earnestness, and on
retiring to her room her first act was to
have his neglected gift&mdash;the little silver
idol&mdash;the bequest of the grateful subadar&mdash;duly
installed on a pretty Swiss bracket,
and next morning she determined to
discover why his manner, after their return
from Dunsinane, had been so marked and
disagreeable to her, even if she should
take the initiative, and have to recur to
the conversation which ended so abruptly
on the preceding evening.
</p>

<p>
She entered the breakfast-room full of
the subject, and dressed&mdash;so far as lace
and blue ribbons went&mdash;in a most
attractive and coquettish morning costume;
but Allan was not there&mdash;he was at the
stables, no doubt, or at the kennel.  How
tiresome men were, she thought.
</p>

<p>
'Good morning, Olive darling!  how
charming you look&mdash;I must positively give
you a kiss!' exclaimed the not usually
effusive Lady Aberfeldie, touching the
girl's cheek with her lips.
</p>

<p>
The last to appear at the breakfast-table
was her husband, who entered with a note
in his hand, and an expression of surprise
on his face.
</p>

<p>
'Here is a strange thing, Eveline,' said
he to Lady Aberfeldie.  'Tappleton has
just brought me this note from
Allan&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'From Allan!' exclaimed one or two
voices.
</p>

<p>
'Stating that he would leave by dawn
this morning to take the train for the
south, and might be absent some time,
and this without further explanation.'
</p>

<p>
'How odd&mdash;how unlike him!' exclaimed
Lady Aberfeldie.  'Do you know of any
business engagement or invitation he had?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;I know of nothing.'
</p>

<p>
'Or you, Olive&mdash;or you, Mr. Cameron?'
</p>

<p>
All professed ignorance, and the matter
was canvassed by the family circle in
vain.
</p>

<p>
'It will be explained, of course.  Allan
never acts without reason,' said his father,
addressing himself to the morning
meal.
</p>

<p>
'Allan gone&mdash;how odd&mdash;how unaccountable!'
was the thought of Olive, whose
heart rather reproached her; and now, for
a little time, she missed the handsome
cousin whom she had so teased, worried,
and mortified; and she began to dread
that he had resigned his leave of
absence, and gone abruptly to rejoin his
regiment.
</p>

<p>
'Olive,' said Lady Aberfeldie, 'do go on
with your breakfast.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, auntie, I have finished.'
</p>

<p>
'Finished!&mdash;child, you have taken
nothing: Tappleton will get you a little
grouse-pie.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, no&mdash;thanks,' replied Olive, and,
rising from the table, she quitted the room.
The eyes of her aunt and Holcroft followed
her, as each had thoughts of their own.
</p>

<p>
The love the latter professed for her was
destitute of jealousy, but was not without
fear; and his face just then would have
been a picture had anyone cared to study
it.
</p>

<p>
There might have been read satisfaction
that by Allan's unexpected departure he
had the field all to himself; annoyance, for
the Dundargue despatch-box often brought
him, and on this morning had done so,
epistles in blue envelopes, which he cared
not to receive; greed, as he thought of the
prize that might yet be his; and hot
impatience to find it in his grasp; and thus,
while affecting to listen to Lord Aberfeldie,
who was describing to him and Sir Paget
a cover they were to shoot over that day,
his mind was revolving how he might
succeed in entrapping Olive Raymond into
some kind of Scotch marriage (whatever
that was) in fun, or jest, and then declare
it was a true and solemn ceremony.  He
thought he had heard of such things being
tried and done, but was not quite certain.
</p>

<p>
However, he took fresh courage now
that he would have her all to himself, and
thought, with Bulwer, that 'thrones and
bread man wins by the aid of others.
Fame and woman's heart he can only gain
through himself.'
</p>

<p>
Not that he cared much for fame or
woman's heart either; but he could
mightily appreciate her fortune.
</p>

<p>
Whatever was the secret thought of
Olive about the sudden and unexpected
departure of Allan, she felt some renewal
of her pique, but of a different kind, when
told by Eveline of the magnificent suite of
Maltese ornaments he had brought home.
</p>

<p>
'For whom?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'You, of course.'
</p>

<p>
'Then he has never offered them for my
acceptance.'
</p>

<p>
'Think of your manner to him, Olive.'
</p>

<p>
'They are for Ruby Logan more likely.
He has met Ruby before, we all know.'
</p>

<p>
'I should not be surprised if they
become a gift to Ruby now,' replied Eveline,
who was quietly provoked by Olive's
treatment of her brother; 'though, when
he got these jewels at Malta, I question if
he knew of that yellow-haired damsel's
existence.'
</p>

<p>
And now, greatly to the vexation of
Eveline, and the amusement perhaps of
Olive, the latter's bangle remained on the
wrist of the enterprising Mr. Holcroft,
though none of them knew the mischief
that the discovery of it had wrought in the
mind of Allan Graham; but in the latter's
absence poor little Eveline was doomed to
have&mdash;unsupported by his presence and
advice&mdash;some heavy trouble of her own.
</p>

<p>
Lord and Lady Aberfeldie were in
consultation in the latter's boudoir, a little,
old-fashioned room of octagonal shape, the
panelled walls of which were hung with
rich silk&mdash;a sanctum long sacred to the
Chatelaines of Dundargue, and the whole
appurtenances of which had that combined
air of ease, repose, and grandeur peculiar
to the furniture of an ancient and
long-descended race.
</p>

<p>
Kelpie&mdash;a currish-looking terrier, but
her ladyship's pet&mdash;had got his morning
repast of cream and macaroons from her
own white hands, and, this important duty
over, she and her husband began to
converse on family matters.
</p>

<p>
Lady Aberfeldie amid these, indulged in
some angry surmises as to how long they
were 'to have the society of Mr. Holcroft.'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot say that I care much personally
for Hawke Holcroft,' replied her
husband; 'but his father, as you know, saved
my life at Alma, and won therefore the V.C.
I have told you, Eveline, I think, that when
Colin Campbell's Highland brigade
advanced in <i>echelon</i> of regiments along the
Kourgané Hill, the Black Watch, of course,
led the way, and, just about the time the
Russian Kazan column broke, no particular
sound had followed our firing but the yells
of their wounded ringing through the
smoke.  With the next volley we heard a
rattling sound, as our bullets fell like hail
upon the tin-kettles they carried outside
their knapsacks, as all the great grey-coated
blocks of infantry were <i>right about face</i> now,
in full retreat.  It was just then, as our
calvary and guns swept after them in
pursuit, that I fell wounded, and would have
been bayoneted on the spot by four Russians,
who lay among some caper bushes shamming
death, had not old Major Holcroft cut them
down like ninepins, and protected me till
some of our fellows returned.  I cannot
forget all that, you know.'
</p>

<p>
Lady Aberfeldie, who had heard all this
fifty times at least before, sighed with
impatience, and said,
</p>

<p>
'His son certainly appears to have some
attraction for Olive; and what would you
think if Allan, repelled by her, was actually
to fall in love with Ruby Logan and her
amber locks?  What a complication that
might be.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't suggest such a thing for a moment.
I hope he will prove himself every
way worthy of one who has so long occupied,
like Eveline, the place of a daughter in our
hearts.'
</p>

<p>
'Talking of Eveline, it is high time she
was informed of Sir Paget's views and
wishes; and while on the subject may I
ask,' she added, with some asperity of
tone, 'how long Mr. Cameron is to be
here?'
</p>

<p>
'A week yet, and then he must report
himself at head-quarters.'
</p>

<p>
'A whole week?' muttered lady Aberfeldie,
who was far from inhospitable when
she approved of the objects to whom she
thought hospitality should be extended.
</p>

<p>
'I do like Stratherroch.  He is like his
father, old Angus of the Cameron Highlanders,
yet not so lively; for Angus was the
king of good fellows, and used to keep the
mess-table in a roar.'
</p>

<p>
'Yet I would his son were with the regiment
again, or anywhere else but here.'
</p>

<p>
'I think he admires Eveline.'
</p>

<p>
'I am certain of it, and the sooner their
intimacy terminates the better.  Eveline
and Strath&mdash;good heavens!' exclaimed
Lady Aberfeldie, with her white jewelled
hands uplifted, 'never again must their
names be mingled, even in our family
circle, especially under pending circumstances.'
</p>

<p>
'They do seem intimate,' said the peer,
moodily; 'but have not at least progressed
so far as the use of Christian names.'
</p>

<p>
'That would be intolerable:' and, ringing
the bell, Lady Aberfeldie desired a servant
to summon her daughter, who appeared in
a very coquettish and becoming lawn-tennis
costume, for a game on the lawn, where
the courts were already set and some friends
awaited.
</p>

<p>
She entered with a bright smile, which
soon died away, for she read an expression
in the faces of her parents, especially
that of her mother, which seemed to her
sensitive heart prophetic of evil.
</p>

<p>
If it be true, as Madame be Stael asserts,
that 'love occupies the whole life of a
woman,' it need not be a matter of surprise
that the sex can discover each other's love
secrets with ease; thus, though Lady
Aberfeldie fully suspected what filled the
heart of her daughter&mdash;so closely had she
watched her&mdash;she was somewhat pitiless
now.
</p>

<p>
With all her queenly manner and soft
grace, her unexceptional toilettes and
suavity of manner, Lady Aberfeldie had a will
of iron, yea, of adamant in some things,
and her daughter's marriage with Sir Paget
was one of them.
</p>

<p>
She was told plainly and bluntly that he
had proposed for her hand; had asked
permission to address her on the subject; had
offered magnificent&mdash;yea, princely settlements;
and it was expected the marriage
would take place, when the family returned
to London, next season.
</p>

<p>
The long dreaded cloud had burst upon
her at last!
</p>

<p>
She grew white as a lily on hearing this
sentence, clung to a console table for
support, and then burst into a torrent of tears,
while her father drew her tenderly towards him.
</p>

<p>
'Be calm, child,' said he, 'we shall give
you plenty of time to think about it;
marriage is a serious thing at all times.'
</p>

<p>
Eveline thought it was doubly serious
with such a bridegroom, but could only sob,
while her mother eyed her gloomily, as
she thought this excessive grief and
repugnance augured worse for her scheme than
indignation or defiance would have done;
but poor Eveline was all softness and
gentleness.
</p>

<p>
'What folly is this?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'I am your only daughter, mamma,'
urged Eveline.
</p>

<p>
'Hence it is your first duty to your
family, to yourself, and the world to make
an early, eligible, and wealthy marriage.
Every season brings many such to pass in
our own circle.'
</p>

<p>
'Are we so poor, mamma?'
</p>

<p>
'We are not rich, and know not what
may happen.'
</p>

<p>
Did Lady Aberfeldie speak prophetically?
If so, it was an utterance made
unawares.
</p>

<p>
'Eveline darling,' said her father, 'you
were content enough with the attentions of
Sir Paget, and to accept even his presents
in London, a season or two ago.'
</p>

<p>
'I was but a girl then fresh from school,
and&mdash;and joined other girls in laughing at
my having an old lover.  I&mdash;I knew no
better,' she continued, sobbing.
</p>

<p>
'And had not met Cameron of Stratherroch!'
said her mother through her set
teeth, and quite forgetting the <i>rôle</i> she had
so recently suggested.
</p>

<p>
'No,' thought Eveline, 'and had not
learned to love him.'  She shivered as if
she had been struck when her mother spoke,
and then said, with all the firmness she
could assume.
</p>

<p>
'You must mistake us in some way,
mamma.  Mr. Cameron has never addressed
a word to me that he might not have
addressed to yourself.'
</p>

<p>
'I am glad of it&mdash;then I shall taunt you
with his name no more,' said her mother,
kissing her forehead.  'People generally,
but young ladies especially, should never
indulge in strong emotions.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps, mamma; but why?'
</p>

<p>
'They age the face so much by lining it.'
</p>

<p>
Eveline covered with her handkerchief
her whole sweet face, which was quivering
with emotion now.  She felt that the romance
of her young girl's life was quite passing
from her, and that, even if she escaped
a marriage with Sir Paget, she must think
of Evan Cameron and his silent love no
more!
</p>

<p>
'Think of Sir Paget's princely settlements,'
said Lord Aberfeldie.  'But how
difficult it is,' he added, as if to himself, 'to
imbue a woman&mdash;a pretty girl more than
all&mdash;with any idea of the seriousness of
pounds, shillings, and pence!  To her they
are as the sands upon the seashore, unless
she has known want.'
</p>

<p>
'Do reflect on all this, Eveline,' urged
her mother.
</p>

<p>
'I cannot; and why should I do so?'
</p>

<p>
'Because most of the great evils of life
might be avoided if we would only take
time to reflect.'
</p>

<p>
'In a matter like this, mamma,' said
Eveline, taking courage from her desperation,
and hoping by temporising to gain,
at least, time, 'reflection might lead to
madness.  Can wealth or princely settlements
make up for that disparity of years
which will excite ridicule in all the girls
who know me, and cover me with contempt
as a mean, sordid, and covetous creature
in marrying a man I do not and can never
love, and who cannot really care for me,
whatever he may think or say?  So, so, I
am to be taken to market, as it were, and
sold to the best advantage.  That is the
plain English of it!'
</p>

<p>
'Eveline, how can you adopt a tone so
little like you?' said her mother, reproachfully.
'Sir Paget will be sure to address
you on this subject, as he has your papa's
permission, and, when he does so, be sure
that you comport yourself as becomes my
daughter,' she added, rather haughtily, and
rather ignoring her husband in the matter.
'But go; I hear Olive and Miss Logan
calling for you.'
</p>

<p>
Eveline hurried away, bathed her eyes,
and then, hat in hand, descended from the
terrace to the sunny lawn, where Olive,
Ruby, and other girls were flitting about,
radiant with smiles and in gaily-coloured
costumes, with saucy and bewitching hats,
talking and laughing merrily; but the girl
felt as one in a dream, a nightmare.  A
dark cloud seemed to envelop her, amid
which she heard the voices of her friends,
and it may be imagined with what
emotions in her breast she saw in the
tennis-court opposite her, Cameron, looking so
handsome in a kind of athlete's flannel
dress, and the rotund figure of Sir Paget
in a tight morning coat, out of the neck of
which his round, shining head was jerked
ever and anon in the turtle fashion we
have described.
</p>

<p>
Never while she lived, Eveline thought,
should she forget the horror she had of
that game of lawn-tennis; the part she had
to act in it under a glorious sunshine, and
the desire she had for the seclusion of her
own room, for by contrast with the chaos
in her own heart the whole bright scene
became a species of grim phantasmagoria.
</p>

<p>
Her heart seemed full of tears; her
naturally buoyant and happy spirit was
crushed.  She dared hardly trust herself
to address even Cameron, who saw, with a
lover's instinct, that something, he knew
not what (unless with reference to Sir
Paget), had gone decidedly wrong.
</p>

<p>
We have already adverted to the strong
passion an elderly swain like Sir Paget
may conceive for a young girl; and,
encouraged by her parents' permission, he
was now giving full swing to it, as he
watched her slender, lithe, and willowy
figure in the various postures incident to
the game, which tested his powers of action
severely, and during a pause in it he
approached her with a smile rippling on his
rubicund old face, and displaying a set of
teeth that were first-rate as to cost and
quality.
</p>

<p>
'My dear Miss Graham,' he said, with a
most insinuating jerk of his head, 'why do
you avoid me?'
</p>

<p>
'I am not aware that I avoid you; I
hope I don't do so,' replied Eveline,
colouring with annoyance, and at the conviction
that she certainly had done so.  Then, as
a kind of hunted feeling came over her,
she added; 'but I do not think, Sir Paget,
that I am bound to account to you for all
I do.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course not,' said he, with a bow, and
Eveline coloured more deeply at the
ungraciousness of her own speech; 'of course
not, my dear young lady&mdash;<i>as yet</i>,' he added,
under his breath.
</p>

<p>
At last she pleaded illness, fatigue, and
headache, threw down her hat, and fairly
fled to her own room.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
A REVELATION TO HOLCROFT.
</h3>

<p>
The sudden, unexpected, and unexplained
departure of Allan Graham from Dundargue
(a reason for which will be given in
due time), if it puzzled his family, still
more puzzled and piqued Olive, especially
after what passed between them on their
homeward ride.  But then, says
Lefanu,&mdash;'Women are so enigmatical; some in
everything&mdash;all in matters of the heart.'
</p>

<p>
The monetary matters of Mr. Hawke
Holcroft were approaching a species of
crisis now, and he was daily getting
orange-coloured missives and messages
'wired' in mysterious terms from jockeys,
bookmakers, and other horsey folks that
added to his tribulation, for things seemed
to be going wrong with him, and he felt
that now or never must he attempt to
secure the heiress, who, he thought, was
only waiting to be carried off.
</p>

<p>
Even loo and écarté in the evening
with such pigeon-like players as Sir Paget
were beginning to fail as resources.
</p>

<p>
'Odd fellow in his way,' remarked the
baronet to Cameron.  'A trifle too lucky
at cards for my taste.'
</p>

<p>
'Or mine,' said Cameron, grimly.
</p>

<p>
'Turns up the king too often after the
early hours of the morning.'
</p>

<p>
Yet when night came again and the
small hours of the morning, the somewhat
simple M.P. for Slough-cum-Sloggit was
again a heavy loser to Holcroft.
</p>

<p>
'He has some secret about him,' said
the former.
</p>

<p>
'Most men have some secret which they
generally keep to themselves,' replied
Cameron.
</p>

<p>
'Secrets certainly, which they seldom
tell to their wives or sweethearts,' said the
baronet, laughing.
</p>

<p>
We have said that Olive had a secret
thought that might prove somewhat fatal
to Allan's success with her, a mistaken
idea that Holcroft loved her&mdash;loved her
for herself&mdash;and despite the tenor of her
father's will; while Allan might love her
because he knew the value of its tenor to
himself.
</p>

<p>
And, now that the latter was so unaccountably
absent, Holcroft was full of confidence,
and, the ice having once been
broken, thought it would be easy to go
back to where he had left off on the ride
home from Dunsinane.
</p>

<p>
In his own selfish way he loved her;
but then she was beautiful.  Loved her!
'Oh, poverty of language, that we must so
often use the word love!' exclaims a writer.
</p>

<p>
It was some days before his inevitable
departure from Dundargue (and not an
hour too soon for that), when he and
Olive were somewhat earlier, and before
anyone else, in the breakfast-room, and
the notes of Ronald Gair's pipes, playing
his morning reveille, 'The Black Watch,'
a slow and wailing air, were dying away
on the terrace outside.
</p>

<p>
Holcroft's face looked worn and
haggard&mdash;more freckled, and the eyes more
than usually shifty in their expression.
He had received some letters and
telegrams the evening before that upset him
so much that he failed even to win at loo
or écarté, and the live-long night he had
been heard by Cameron pacing to and fro,
as if unable to rest.
</p>

<p>
Olive was struck by his pallid appearance.
</p>

<p>
They exchanged 'Good-mornings,' and
then a few minutes' silence ensued.
</p>

<p>
'We may have rain soon.' was the not
very original remark of Holcroft.
</p>

<p>
'The sky looks very like it.  Rain
always comes when the mist is where we
see it now, on yonder low spur of the
Sidlaw Hills,' replied Olive.
</p>

<p>
She was kneeling on a bearskin, beside
the great staghounds, Shiuloch and Bran,
with her little white hands outspread
before the fire for warmth; and a charming
picture she made, in her morning costume,
fresh and lovely as a fairy, with the
dogs in the foreground, and the great
carved stone arch of the baronial
chimney-piece for a frame.
</p>

<p>
Hawke Holcroft turned from the window
and came to her side, though curiously
enough the hazel eyes of the hounds
glistened, and they showed their teeth at
him, suggestive of kicks secretly administered.
</p>

<p>
'We are down earlier than usual this
morning,' said she.
</p>

<p>
'All the better.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'I want so particularly to talk to you,'
said he, with all the softness he could
assume.
</p>

<p>
'And I with you,' said Olive, with a
frankness that was a curious mistake.  'You
leave us soon, I believe?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'For London?'
</p>

<p>
'For London,' he replied, mechanically,
as it were.
</p>

<p>
'I thought you came to stay out the
grouse-shooting?'
</p>

<p>
'Till the tenth of December!  I have
not been asked,' he replied, gnawing his
yellow moustache; and then, after a pause,
added, 'would <i>you</i> wish that I stayed?'
</p>

<p>
'Certainly, if you are enjoying yourself,'
was the girl's frank but&mdash;after what he
had urged some time ago&mdash;rather rash
response.
</p>

<p>
His eyes sparkled&mdash;he drew nearer.
</p>

<p>
'Miss Raymond&mdash;Olive!' he exclaimed,
but paused, as, at that moment, Lady Aberfeldie
swept into the room; 'on the terrace&mdash;the
terrace after breakfast,' he whispered,
hurriedly, and then turned to receive his
hostess's morning greeting, which was so
frigid that he feared she had overheard
him call her niece by her Christian name.
</p>

<p>
Holcroft was rather abstracted at
breakfast; thus Ruby Logan, who had been
watching him, said,
</p>

<p>
'I would not, if I were you, put more
sugar on the devilled turkey; it won't
improve it.'
</p>

<p>
'Forgot it was not salt; thanks, Miss
Logan,' stammered Holcroft.
</p>

<p>
Now, whether the charming Olive was
inspired by coquetry, curiosity, caprice, or
a strange desire to play with fire, we know
not; but when breakfast was over she laid
down a novel she had been reading, or
affecting to read, at intervals during the
meal, and, assuming her garden hat, with
all the laces and ribbons of her bright
morning dress fluttering about her, while
everyone else at table was deep in his or
her letters and papers, went forth
upon&mdash;the terrace!
</p>

<p>
Now Mr. Hawke Holcroft never read
novels or anything else unless for a
purpose.  He glanced at the page which Olive
had left open (the work was 'Miss
Forrester') and the passage struck him as
most <i>apropos</i> to himself:
</p>

<p>
'I never pretended to goodness.  I have
certain views for myself.  I never
pretended to fooling.  I am clever.  What
stands between me and my ambition I will
remove; of whatever can administer to it
I will avail myself.  Beyond this, it seems
to me, I am as good as other people.'
</p>

<p>
'Hawke, my boy, yourself to a hair!'
thought he, as he quietly sought the terrace,
not by the French window, as Olive had
done, but by going through a corridor and
the entrance hall.
</p>

<p>
As coolly as if she had no prevision of
what he was sure to urge, Olive, who wore
a waggish yet shy expression under her
garden hat, and who kept her hands deep
in the pockets of her morning dress, said,
</p>

<p>
'What have you to say to me here that
you could not have said in the vicinity of
the tea-urn?'
</p>

<p>
'All that I have to say may be said in
three words.'
</p>

<p>
'Three! say it then.'
</p>

<p>
'I love you; a confession that has
hovered on my timid lips many a time.'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot listen to this, and I wish to
have back my bangle.  If Allan were to see
it&mdash;good heavens!'
</p>

<p>
'I have said that it shall be buried with
me.  Do give me some hope.'
</p>

<p>
'Of what; permission to retain the
bangle?'
</p>

<p>
'No; that you may one day love me.'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot.'
</p>

<p>
'Say rather that you will not.'
</p>

<p>
Barring, in an angle of the terrace, her
attempts to leave him, he continued, in an
earnestness that was born of monetary
pressure and desperate hope, to plead his passion.
</p>

<p>
'I am greatly honoured,' replied the girl,
growing cold as he waxed warm, and
glancing nervously at the windows of the
mansion; 'but I am very sorry&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'That you don't love me.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'But you may in time.  Oh, how I could
teach you to do so!  Let me wait and
strive, Olive.  You deem me wild,
perhaps&mdash;horsey, and all that sort of thing; but
do you think a man never changes, never
grows better, under a woman's softening
influence?  Are you entirely to let this
family compact, whatever it may be,
Olive&mdash;pardon me, Miss Raymond,' he added, as
he saw how her face clouded by the
reference to her position&mdash;'are you intending
to let it stand between you and all other
chances of marriage?'
</p>

<p>
'You have no right to question me thus,
or to assume this interest in my affairs,
Mr. Holcroft.'
</p>

<p>
'Pardon me, but I have a love for you
that will last while life does.'
</p>

<p>
He did not add that it was the love
of&mdash;her money.
</p>

<p>
'If there is only the Master, your cousin,
between us, that is no barrier, as I know
you don't love him.'
</p>

<p>
'Then you know more of me than I do
of myself,' said Olive, provoked by his blunt
brusquerie of manner, and failing to be
flattered by his pertinacity just then.
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps you deem me an heiress?'
said Olive, as a new light suddenly broke
upon her.
</p>

<p>
'My dear Miss Raymond,' stammered
Holcroft, colouring with surprise at the
abruptness of her question.  'I never
thought upon the subject; I only knew
that&mdash;that&mdash;I am not just now a man of
fortune; my place in Essex&mdash;&mdash;' he paused,
thinking the less he said about it the better.
'But who thinks of pelf when the heart is
full of passion!' he added, magnanimously.
'But tell me now,' said he, in his most suave
tone, 'do you care for anyone else more
than for me?'
</p>

<p>
'I don't care for you at all&mdash;at least
in the way you mean,' she replied, defiantly.
</p>

<p>
He ground his teeth, even while he
smiled, and thought,
</p>

<p>
'I must have patience before I tempt
my fate again!'
</p>

<p>
Hawke Holcroft had made it so much a
habit during his sojourn at Dundargue to be
in close attendance upon Olive&mdash;especially
when they were alone together&mdash;that his
lovemaking took her less by surprise.  In
a spirit of pique she had permitted him to
dangle, and to play&mdash;if we may use the
term&mdash;at admiration for herself; but, now
that he had become serious a second time,
she became alarmed.
</p>

<p>
The remark which had escaped her had
excited some surprise in the mind of
Holcroft, as it interested him deeply; thus he
said, in a low soft voice,
</p>

<p>
'You referred to your not being an
heiress, Miss Raymond, as if <i>that</i> could
possibly make any difference with one who
loves you as&mdash;as&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'There, there, that will do!' interrupted
the impetuous Olive; 'I am <i>not</i> an heiress,
in one sense, but very much of a beggar, if
you knew all,' she added, in a voice that
faltered.
</p>

<p>
He regarded her with some bewilderment,
as well he might, and said,
</p>

<p>
'My dear Miss Raymond, what am I to
understand by this paradox?'
</p>

<p>
'Understand that I must marry my
cousin Allan, or forfeit papa's fortune&mdash;it
goes to him if I refuse, or to charities.'
</p>

<p>
Her distinctness and vehemence carried
conviction with her words.  Holcroft was
confounded; but, being a practised
dissembler, he only smiled, and said,
</p>

<p>
'A most remarkable arrangement, and a
tyrannical one for you.  But suppose the
Master had died in his boyhood&mdash;or were
to die now?'
</p>

<p>
'The will would be worthless in effect,
of course, I suppose,' replied Olive, whose
cheeks now burned scarlet, for&mdash;always a
creature of hot impulse&mdash;she now thought,
'<i>why</i> should I have permitted my self to speak
to <i>him</i>, one, almost a stranger, or to any
man, of papa's will?  What must he think
of me!  Oh, what will Aunt Aberfeldie say?'
</p>

<p>
For half a minute Holcroft was silent.
He was thinking, 'this must be all bosh!&mdash;a
cock and a bull, or a madman's will; she
doesn't know what she is talking
about&mdash;no woman or girl ever knows business.
Well&mdash;I've a pull on her anyway; a viscount's
niece isn't in a fellow's power every
day, as she will find herself in mine.'
</p>

<p>
What he referred to we shall show ere
long.
</p>

<p>
While Olive was still crimson with
reflections on her own imprudence, Holcroft
took possession of her passive hands, and
said, in a partly assumed voice of agitation,
</p>

<p>
'You told me, Miss Raymond&mdash;let me
say Olive&mdash;a minute or two ago that you
did not care for me.  I shall not take that
as your final answer; and ere I leave
Dundargue, when I again venture to speak
to you on the subject nearest my heart,
your reply&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Will too probably be the same,' replied
Olive, wrenching away her hands, as steps
were heard near, and she hastily re-entered
the house.
</p>

<p>
The footsteps heard were those of Allan,
who came leisurely up the flight, a broad
and stately one, which led to the terrace.
He had, while proceeding down the avenue,
observed the pair together, and, as it
seemed to him, in rather too close proximity.
He also remarked Olive's abrupt departure,
at <i>his</i> approach as he supposed, and his
soul become ireful within him; but he felt
himself, as he gave a hand to Holcroft,
compelled to dissemble.
</p>

<p>
So did the latter who met him smilingly.
</p>

<p>
'Welcome home to Dundargue,' he
exclaimed; 'you have come back as
unexpectedly as you went; but whither?'
</p>

<p>
'Only as far as Edinburgh.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah.'  The reply seemed rather to relieve
Holcroft.  Nothing was known about
him there, he thought.
</p>

<p>
'A lady was on the terrace with you
just now?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;Miss Raymond.'
</p>

<p>
'So I thought&mdash;sorry she did not stay.'
</p>

<p>
'Why&mdash;particularly?'
</p>

<p>
'I have some news that may interest her.'
</p>

<p>
'About whom?'
</p>

<p>
'Herself.'
</p>

<p>
'Hope they are pleasant?'
</p>

<p>
'That will depend upon how she may
view them,' said Allan, with a nod, as he
entered the house.
</p>

<p>
'Now, what the deuce has he been up
to&mdash;this fellow, with his hair cut to the
military pattern&mdash;Newgate crop, I should
call it&mdash;he looks queer this morning,'
muttered Holcroft, as he selected a cigar from
his case, bit the end off with his sharp
white teeth, and proceeded to smoke it with
brief, angry, and unenjoyable puffs that
indicated a mind full of bitterness and ill
at ease.  Olive's communication had been
a sudden revelation to him.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
ALLAN PROVES MYSTERIOUS.
</h3>

<p>
If Allan's sudden departure and unexplained
absence excited some curiosity in the
minds of his family, his return excited it
afresh when he declined to make any
explanation until he had held an interview
with his cousin, Olive Raymond, who, for
a time, secluded herself in her own room
on the usual feminine plea of having a
headache.
</p>

<p>
Eveline, who had so longed for his
return, now with tears told him of her
father's frequently expressed wish&mdash;nay,
command, and Sir Paget's forthcoming
proposal; but, full of his own miseries, he
could only caress her and say,
</p>

<p>
'God bless you, little one.  I wish you
well over all this.'
</p>

<p>
Sir Paget had left Dundargue pending
the final arrangements, as he thought; thus
the cloud and the dread were hanging over
her still.
</p>

<p>
'Has Olive received back her gold
bangle&mdash;my gift&mdash;from Mr. Holcroft?' asked
Allan, with knitted brows.
</p>

<p>
'I&mdash;I think not.  How did you learn he
had it?'
</p>

<p>
'Plainly enough&mdash;I saw it on his
wrist!'
</p>

<p>
'Where he put it, in play&mdash;not she.'
</p>

<p>
'I should hope not, by Jove!'
</p>

<p>
'I know she has asked him for it repeatedly.'
</p>

<p>
'Can't make the beggar out.'
</p>

<p>
'I can&mdash;he thinks Olive an heiress.
</p>

<p>
Allan's dark brow became more deeply
knitted.
</p>

<p>
'She thinks that if she married you,
Allan dear,' said his sister, after a pause,
'she would be sacrificing her own pride and
liberty, and that you might marry her
though not caring for her&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'But for that wretched money?' said
Allan, with a kind of snort.  'Poor Olive&mdash;she
views the situation in this light!  I
certainly shall not ask her to make any
sacrifices for me, and, so far as I am concerned,
she shall be free as a bird in the air.'
</p>

<p>
His sister regarded him now with some
perplexity, not understanding what he
meant, but said,
</p>

<p>
'You have just come in time for a little
carpet-dance we have arranged as a
farewell treat to Ruby Logan, Mr. Holcroft,
and&mdash;and Evan Cameron, who are about
to leave Dundargue.'
</p>

<p>
Allan noted the inflection of her voice
as she uttered the name of his young brother
officer, and then hurried away, as their
mother entered the room, and with rather
a cloudy expression in her face, though he
hastened to kiss her.
</p>

<p>
'You have been to Edinburgh, I have
heard,' she said.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'About what, Allan?'
</p>

<p>
'That you will learn in time, mother.  I
must speak with Olive first.'
</p>

<p>
Lady Aberfeldie was full of irrepressible
curiosity, but Allan declined to gratify it
just then.
</p>

<p>
'Have your recent movements any
reference to Olive?'
</p>

<p>
'You will learn in time, mother.'
</p>

<p>
Lady Aberfeldie's face shaded with
annoyance, for, only the day before, she and
the petulant young lady in question had
indulged in a tift between them.
</p>

<p>
Perceiving a wistful look and fitful
manner about Olive, and that she was more
than usually restless and irritable, Lady
Aberfeldie had unwisely spoken to her on
the subject of Allan's regard for her.
</p>

<p>
Olive had sat for a moment or two, with
her delicate hands tightly interlaced in her
lap, and then, turning defiantly to her
aunt, she said,
</p>

<p>
'I will never marry Allan!'
</p>

<p>
'You must marry Allan, my dear girl,'
replied Lady Aberfeldie, calmly and firmly.
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'You know your father's wish.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, the will, of course!  So I am to be
treated like a child?  Well, if so, I may
prove a wilful and dangerous one!'
</p>

<p>
Her aunt's report of this conversation
made Lord Aberfeldie more than ever
anxious for the return of his son.
</p>

<p>
'You are very mysterious, Allan.  You
and Olive seem a pair of enigmas,' said
Lady Aberfeldie.  'But your father waits
you in the library, and perhaps you will
condescend to confide in him, if not in me.
I must own it will be a fatal thing for your
future happiness if Olive thinks you seek
her for gain; but for what does Mr. Holcroft
so evidently seek her?'
</p>

<p>
Allan smiled disdainfully.
</p>

<p>
'I have tried to think, mother dear, that
she is not affected by this person Holcroft,
but begin to own to myself that "the faith
that worketh miracles" is not in me.'
</p>

<p>
When questioned by his father, Allan
made the same reticent reply, that he must
see Olive before making any explanations.
</p>

<p>
'The time has come now, Allan,' said
Lord Aberfeldie, 'when you are bound in
honour to make your cousin an offer, for
in this peculiar entanglement&mdash;for such,
I grant you, it is&mdash;you and she do not stand
in the position of most engaged persons.'
</p>

<p>
'But suppose I have no wish to marry&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Absurd&mdash;outrageous!'
</p>

<p>
'Or may not marry at all?'
</p>

<p>
'By the refusal of Olive?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Then her fortune, or most of it, becomes
yours, in terms of the will&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Which has been a curse to us both.  In
her mind, and in the eyes of all who may
come to hear of it, we must lie under the
degrading imputation of a mercenary
motive.'
</p>

<p>
'Not if you act with tact and delicacy,
and surely your boy-and-girl attachment
must remain unchanged,' said Lord Aberfeldie,
in a voice that was soft, rather than
indignant, as his memory went back to the
day when Olive first came a little orphan
child to Dundargue&mdash;a tiny and graceful
creature, with tender, wondering, and
beseeching eyes&mdash;a child that climbed upon
his knee, clung to him with sympathetic
love, and played with his watch-chain or
the tassels of his sash, if he was in uniform.
'And so,' he added, after a pause, 'you must
propose to the dear girl as a mere matter of
form.'
</p>

<p>
'I have already done so,' said Allan,
recalling, what he was not likely to forget,
all that had occurred during the homeward
ride from Dunsinane.
</p>

<p>
'Well, sir?' asked his father.
</p>

<p>
'I was laughed at&mdash;mocked, I may say.'
</p>

<p>
'Impossible!  The girl must have been
jesting with you.'
</p>

<p>
'I do not think so,' said Allan, both sadly
and bitterly as he thought of the bangle
and many other circumstances, the inevitable
'trifles light as air.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, you are bound to renew your
proposal.'
</p>

<p>
'I do not think so, nor shall I again,
unless some change comes over her.'
</p>

<p>
'If I exert my authority as guardian
and trustee&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'She may run away.  Olive is a proud
and restless girl with a defiant spirit, though
she has a very affectionate heart.'
</p>

<p>
'But you cannot expect that she is to
propose to <i>you</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'I do love her, father&mdash;love her dearly;
but fear that she views me too much as a
brother to love me otherwise.'
</p>

<p>
'This is rank nonsense.  Think of your
separations, and of your last&mdash;one well
nigh seven years&mdash;with the Black Watch.'
</p>

<p>
'But might it not be the case that she
may have a <i>penchant</i> for some one else?'
</p>

<p>
'For whom?' asked Lord Aberfeldie,
angrily.
</p>

<p>
'Well, say for your friend Mr. Holcroft.'
</p>

<p>
'Penniless Hawke Holcroft! absurd&mdash;the
man has seen but little of her.'
</p>

<p>
'Quite enough in London and here to
learn to admire, if not to love her.  I would,
however, rather see her laid in her grave
than married to Holcroft,' said Allan, in a
stern but broken voice, adding under
his breath, as he left his father's presence
and cut short an unpleasant interview,
'but, so far as I am concerned, she shall be
free to choose for herself&mdash;free as the wind.'
</p>

<p>
'What the deuce can all this mean?'
exclaimed Lord Aberfeldie, in great
perplexity; 'was ever an unfortunate man
more troubled with two intractable girls,
than I am with Eveline and Olive!'
</p>

<p>
It has been said that, 'if exceedingly few
men and women understand each other
when they are in their sober senses, how
must it fare when they are under the
blinding influence of love?'
</p>

<p>
But Allan's course of action was decided
now.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
OLIVE CHANGES HER MIND.
</h3>

<p>
'You are pleased to see me again, Olive?'
</p>

<p>
'Of course, Allan&mdash;why do you ask me?'
she exclaimed, putting both her hands into
his in welcome.
</p>

<p>
He retained them with a tender pressure
for half a minute, looking the while wistfully
into her violet eyes, and then he let
them drop from his clasp.
</p>

<p>
'You wish particularly to speak with me,
I understand?' said Olive, nervously thinking
it must refer to the <i>tête-à-tête</i> he had
overseen on the terrace.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;particularly, dear Olive.'
</p>

<p>
When he saw her tender beauty, her
grace, and her witchery, and felt all the
subtle charm of her presence, his heart
was wrung by the thought that, by the
very act he had the power to do, and the
suggestions he was about to make to her,
he might place her at the entire disposal of
Hawke Holcroft, of whose real character he
now knew more than formerly.
</p>

<p>
How variable had been the emotions she
had, ever since his return from India,
exhibited towards him!  By turns she had
been changeable and indifferent apparently;
playful, petulant, and imperious; yet
always bewitching and sweet.
</p>

<p>
Seeing the cloudy and sad expression
of his eye, Olive said,
</p>

<p>
'You have not come to scold me for
anything, Allan.  We are at least
friends.'
</p>

<p>
'Would we were more,' said Allan,
remembering what his father had urged but a
few minutes before.
</p>

<p>
'Surely to be cousins is a near enough
relationship.'
</p>

<p>
'Olive,' said he, reproachfully, 'unless
you have formed a distinct attachment for
some one else, I must say I do not
understand you.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't want you to understand me,'
she replied, with half-averted face.
</p>

<p>
'Why are you so hard with me?' he
exclaimed, with a wistful, longing, and
miserable expression in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
She made no reply, so he spoke again.
</p>

<p>
'I have had a long consultation with our
family agent in Edinburgh.'
</p>

<p>
'About what?'
</p>

<p>
'Your affairs and mine, Olive.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>My</i> affairs?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, and I have obtained the opinion of
ruby Logan's father, and of counsel of
much higher&mdash;yes, of the highest&mdash;repute
on the vexed subject of your father's
will&mdash;vexed at least between you and I,
Olive.'
</p>

<p>
She gazed at him with something of
vacant surprise blended with inquiry in her
face.
</p>

<p>
'What I am about to suggest may be
dangerous, as I do not know the terms on
which you permit yourself to be with
this&mdash;Mr. Holcroft&mdash;but I have had excellent
legal advice, and&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Legal advice&mdash;oh, indeed!' she interrupted,
with a toss of her pretty head; 'that is
well, for the laws as made by you men rank
us women with children and lunatics.  And
what says this advice?'
</p>

<p>
'That you can be freed from the trammels
of your father's will&mdash;free, and the
inheritrix of your own great wealth.'
</p>

<p>
She regarded him for a minute with
blank astonishment; then as bright joy
like sunshine spread over her sweet face
and sparkled in the depth of her eyes, she
exclaimed, in a low voice,
</p>

<p>
'Free, do you say, free in my own actions,
and free to bestow papa's money how and
on whom I please?'
</p>

<p>
'On <i>whom</i> you please,' replied Allan,
thinking with intense mortification on
Holcroft, and Holcroft only; for personally he
was far above thinking of the fortune that
might otherwise be his own, as the stars
are above the earth.  'Let me but see all
this matter fully arranged and then I shall
be content,' said he, after a pause, during
which they had been regarding each other;
he, her with sadness, and she him with
bewilderment.  'There are rumours in the
air of a turn-up with the Turks, and of a
war in Egypt, and right glad I am of that!'
</p>

<p>
'Why, Allan?'
</p>

<p>
'Because I'll get attached to the first
army corps that sails, even if the Black
Watch is not going; but that it is sure to
be, as, thank God! the dear old corps is
always in everything.'
</p>

<p>
'And why this joy?'
</p>

<p>
'To get as far away from you as possible,'
he replied, bluntly, in a hollow tone.
</p>

<p>
'Must you do so, Allan?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, unless I mean to drive myself
mad.'
</p>

<p>
'Do you really love me so much&mdash;and&mdash;and,'
she paused, for she seemed touched,
her sweet lips were quivering now.
</p>

<p>
'What more?'
</p>

<p>
'For myself alone,' she asked, softly.
</p>

<p>
'Love you&mdash;oh, Olive.'
</p>

<p>
'There now, don't!' she exclaimed,
turning away her face, and Allan shrank
back.
</p>

<p>
'Playing with me, after all&mdash;after all!'
he muttered.  'Will you please to look at
the opinion of counsel,' he added, drawing
from his pocket a folio document, stitched
with a red thread, and with a broad margin.
</p>

<p>
'What a long story!' she exclaimed, as
she glanced at and read,
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
'Chambers, Edinburgh.
</p>

<p>
'Copy of Counsel's opinion referred to in
letter of 20th October, 1882, on the will of
the late Oliver Raymond, Esq, of Jamaica,
with note of fees thereon.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'What a fearful long story!' exclaimed
Olive again.  'Tell me all about it, Allan? but
pray don't read it.'
</p>

<p>
'The will of your father is herein denounced
as eccentric&mdash;one that no court of
law would enforce, nor could uphold, as in
more than one instance it is not conceived in
strictly legal terms, and, to all intents and
purposes, can be put aside if you choose.
Thus, Olive, you are free&mdash;free from all
the bonds&mdash;if such ever existed&mdash;that
seemed to bind you to me; and I thank God that
it is so, and I shall go to Egypt, perhaps,
with a lighter heart.  All that now remains
to be done is to take the means, if such
are necessary, to have the document set
aside as so much waste paper, and you duly
made mistress of your inheritance, as you
are now of age, in England, at least, where
it is invested.  Thus, you see, Olive, this
opinion of counsel is most valuable to you.'
</p>

<p>
Her soft eyes were brimming over with
tears now, as she mechanically took the
document in her tremulous fingers.
</p>

<p>
'And thus you relinquish me?' she said.
</p>

<p>
'I relinquish, gladly, your fortune, and
all control over your actions, if&mdash;you
choose.'
</p>

<p>
'But I don't choose!  Oh, Allan, how
generous all this is of you.  But I shall not
be less so, nor will I act upon this opinion
of counsel.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'See, thus!'
</p>

<p>
And, tearing it into pieces, she cast them
into the fire-grate.
</p>

<p>
'Illegal as it may be, papa's will must be
now a law to me more than ever.'
</p>

<p>
'And you, Olive?'
</p>

<p>
'Love you, dear Allan, and love you dearly,'
cried the wilful and impulsive girl, as
all her heart went forth to him, and he
pressed her to his breast at last.
</p>

<p>
Doubt, pride, defiance, and petulance
had all passed away, and Olive was all
softness, love, and joy now; and to the pair
time seemed for a term to stand still, and
save their caressing words softly murmured,
and the twitter of birds among the ivy
without, silence appeared to reign in this
room; and nothing seemed to disturb them,
till Olive suddenly started from Allan's
arms.
</p>

<p>
'What is it, love?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'A face at the window!'
</p>

<p>
'Whose face?'
</p>

<p>
'I know not,' she replied, with some
agitation.  'It has just vanished.'
</p>

<p>
She thought, nay, she was sure, it had
the features of Hawke Holcroft, but she
did not <i>say</i> so.  If it were he, how much
had he overheard, how much overseen!
</p>

<p>
But she soon forgot the episode, and that
night at dinner she looked more radiant
than ever, in her suite of Maltese
jewellery&mdash;gold set with orient pearls.
</p>

<p>
'It is usual for engaged ladies to have a
ring,' Allan had whispered, as he slipped a
magnificently jewelled hoop upon her
mystic finger.
</p>

<p>
'Fool that I have been!' thought the
girl.  'How near was I estranging one of
the best and dearest of men in the world,
not for the sake of one immeasurably his
inferior, even worthless perhaps, but in a
spirit of vanity, pique, and suspicion!'
</p>

<p>
'Allan,' she whispered to him softly,
when an opportunity came, 'I see now how
foolish I have been and wilful&mdash;oh, so
wilful!  But we all make mistakes in life, and
require at times each other's pity and
forgiveness.'
</p>

<p>
How sweetly and shyly she looked and
spoke.
</p>

<p>
Hawke Holcroft felt intuitively, and
indeed saw, that there was some sudden
change in the bearing of the pair to each
other, and that a sudden brightness had
come into the faces of all&mdash;even that of
Eveline, usually now so <i>triste</i> and pale&mdash;and
under his sandy moustache he 'wondered
what the devil it all meant,' till his watchful
eyes detected the new and brilliant ring
on the engaged finger of Olive Raymond!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
If Mr. Hawke Holcroft imagined he had
nothing to dread personally from the
Master's sudden visit to Edinburgh he reckoned
without his host, as he would have found
had he overheard a brief conversation
which took place between Allan and his
comrade, young Cameron, as they loitered
in the gun-room looking over old Joe-Mantons,
new rifles, and central-fire breech-loaders, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
He was not slow to perceive very soon
that Allan, usually so suave and pleasant
in manner, treated him now with a kind of
stiffness that was almost hauteur; but he
dissembled his rage and so did Allan, who
had a keen sense of the laws of hospitality,
with the genuine British dread of aught
that might approach a 'scene,' more than
all as the visit of Holcroft was nearly
ended.
</p>

<p>
Poor wretch! he strove well to keep a
brave front in society, while letters that
often lay beside his plate at breakfast were
seen to cloud his brow with perplexity, for
they alluded to wrong horses backed,
I.O.U.'s, bills, and cheques 'referred to
drawer,' and so forth, and he must have
left Dundargue before this, but for a friendly
slip of paper, which he had received from
Lord Aberfeldie, that 'Fool of Quality,' as
he thought him.
</p>

<p>
'Look here, Cameron,' said Allan, as the
twain smoked their cigars in a quiet place.
'It is little wonder to me that you, Sir
Paget Puddicombe, and one or two others
lost at cards with Holcroft as you did.  I
dined with our fellows at the mess in the
Castle when I went to Edinburgh.  There
his name cropped up by the merest chance,
and I was told by Carslogie of Ours that
he was present at a shindy in London,
where this fellow Holcroft, after having an
unprecedented run at cards at a place in
St. James Street, was accused of having the
ace of trumps up his sleeve, from whence
it fell when he was shying a bottle at the
accuser's head.  He talks to the pater
largely of his "place in Essex," or what
remains of it.  Involved in debt to a ruinous
extent, he gave bills right and left, which
were dishonoured.  £10,000 <i>had</i> been
raised upon his estate, in which he had only a
reversionary interest, and, when the mortgagees
called in their money, and the estate
was sold, it did not suffice to pay a tithe of
the sums he had raised in every conceivable
way, and everyone lost their money all
round.  Sharp that!  Yet he scraped
through without punishment.'
</p>

<p>
'By Jove!'
</p>

<p>
'Worse still.  Carslogie told me he was
suspected of causing a horse to fail in a race
through having the bit poisoned; and how
he left a young fellow in the Hussars at
Maidstone in the lurch, by refusing at the
last moment to ride for him a peculiarly
vicious horse, which he had solemnly undertaken
to do, and so causing him to lose the
race, on which he had most imprudently
made a ruinously heavy book.'
</p>

<p>
'And how did it end?'
</p>

<p>
'The report of a pistol that night in the
cavalry barrack announced that the Hussar
had shot himself&mdash;that is all!  And this
is the "young man of the period" whom
my father's confiding simplicity has made
a welcome guest for some weeks back at
Dundargue, and thrown into the society of
my sister and Olive!  But I shall fully open
his eyes the moment our visitor is gone.'
</p>

<p>
But it was rather a pity for his own sake
that Allan did not 'open' Lord Aberfeldie's
eyes a little before that event, and such
being the character of Mr. Hawke Holcroft the
reader may feel less surprised at some of
the things we may have to record of him
ere long.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
THE CARPET-DANCE, AND WHAT CAME OF IT.
</h3>

<p>
Though somewhat of the nature of an
impromptu affair, the 'carpet-dance' partook
of something of a more important kind.
Many guests were invited; the ladies were
in semi-toilet and the gentlemen in evening
dress: but the great dancing-room at
Dundargue was decorated to perfection by the
care of Mr. Tappleton, the butler, the
housekeeper, and gardener, with the rarest
plants, flowers, and ferns the conservatories
could produce, disposed in China and Japanese
jars on pedestals and marble console
tables of the time of Louis XIV., at whose
court a Lord Aberfeldie had once been
ambassador.
</p>

<p>
The fete had been brought about by the
two fair cousins as a farewell treat to the
last of their present guests, who were
departing&mdash;Ruby Logan, Stratherroch,
and&mdash;Mr. Holcroft!
</p>

<p>
Greatly to Eveline's relief, Sir Paget was
gone, but, as if to worry her further, Sir
Paget left for her&mdash;with Lady Aberfeldie&mdash;a
letter referring to his admiration and
regard for her since the last season in
London, and with it a handsome diamond
necklet&mdash;the sight of which in its fragrant
Russian-leather case she loathed&mdash;with
the hope that she would accept and wear
it, in token that she was holding out
brilliant hopes to him when 'they met in town
again.'
</p>

<p>
Eveline flatly declined to accept and wear
the jewellery, so, to her intense annoyance,
it remained as yet in her mother's hands.
She was 'biding her time.'
</p>

<p>
The wealthy suitor had attained a
battered middle-age, while Eveline was still in
the glory of her youth.  True, but he had
both wealth and rank to offer, for though
she was an 'Honourable Miss,' he was a
baronet, and so far as his love went, if it
came late in life, it was, nevertheless, a
kind of overmastering passion.
</p>

<p>
The new emotions of her heart caused
Eveline to reflect more than perhaps she
had ever done before.  It seemed but
yesterday since she and Olive conned their
tasks and practised their scales together
under the eyes of a governess; since they
had gathered bouquets of wild flowers from
the clefts of the rocks of Dundargue, and
made fairy caps of rushes and harebells by
the burnside; happy children both; but
how miserable she was now that she was on
the verge of womanhood, and had learned
to love and to hate; for she loved Evan
Cameron, and hated&mdash;yes, and she blushed
as she admitted it to herself&mdash;she did hate
that smiling and rubicund old interloper,
Sir Paget.
</p>

<p>
'And you will not wear the necklet?'
said Lady Aberfeldie, for the last time.
</p>

<p>
'Do please to excuse me, dearest mamma&mdash;I
cannot&mdash;yet a while.'
</p>

<p>
Lady Aberfeldie was pleased by the half
obedience these words implied.
</p>

<p>
'What ornaments will you wear then?'
she asked.  'You have so many to choose
from.'
</p>

<p>
'Let me wear the lovely diamond necklace
that lies in the strong casket in your
room, mamma.'
</p>

<p>
Lady Aberfeldie's calm, patrician face
darkened.
</p>

<p>
'I would rather you wore no diamonds
at all, child; and these I never wear myself.'
</p>

<p>
'But why, mamma?'
</p>

<p>
'Because that necklace always brings
evil to whoever wears it.'
</p>

<p>
'So I have heard.  But it is a silly
superstition, and they are such lovely
stones!  But what is the story of them?'
</p>

<p>
'The wife of a cavalier who died with
Montrose on the scaffold of Edinburgh
gave them to an ancestor of ours to save
his life.  This was the first viscount, who
was a zealous Covenanter, and the bosom
friend of Lord Warriston.  He certainly
took the jewels from the poor sorrowing
wife&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'And the cavalier?'
</p>

<p>
'Was beheaded by the Maiden at the
market-cross, and a kind of curse seems to
have attended these diamonds ever since.'
</p>

<p>
'A cruel story.'
</p>

<p>
'But a true one.'
</p>

<p>
Eveline laughed at the superstition, kissed
her cold, proud mother, and carried her
point; thus, at the time when carriage after
carriage was depositing guests at the great
arched entrance hall, Eveline was surveying
her figure and face in the mirror with
all a young girl's satisfaction and thinking
that her slender white throat never looked
as it did then, when encircled by the
sparkling diamonds of the luckless widow,
and Olive at the same time was looking
radiant in the Maltese suite of Allan.
</p>

<p>
How the two last named enjoy the
carpet-dance!  Perfect confidence was so
sweetly established between them, they had
so many little secrets to tell, so many
revelations to make, so many comparisons,
of mutual hopes and fears, and so forth,
while each seemed to exult in the affection
of the other, and felt in their hearts the
words ascribed to old Catullus:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Let those love now who never loved before.<br />
  Let those who always loved, now love the more!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Those two young fools seem to
understand each other and each other's interests
at last!' whispered Lord to Lady Aberfeldie,
with a smile of amusement.
</p>

<p>
'But there are two <i>other</i> young fools
present who are doing their best to mar
each other's interests,' was her cold and
warning response.
</p>

<p>
Hawke Holcroft's shifty eyes lowered as
he watched the cousins and whirled in a
waltz with Ruby Logan or any other girl
who came to hand.  He was in utter
perplexity to find the new footing on which
these hitherto strange lovers so suddenly
were, and that he himself was, as he felt
and thought, 'nowhere!'
</p>

<p>
What could she mean?  There was something
of radiance in the faces of all the
family&mdash;even of the sweetly pensive
Eveline&mdash;all indicative of a new movement that
<i>he</i> was out of.
</p>

<p>
'As for Olive,' he muttered, while a
sentiment of rage, mingled with avarice and
jealousy, grew strong in his heart, 'she is
an infernal weather-cock, but a deuced
handsome one!'
</p>

<p>
Ruby Logan was equally puzzled, but
found consolation with young Carslogie of
the Black Watch, whom Allan had invited
to the festivity, and who styled her, with
reference to her hair, 'the amber witch.'
</p>

<p>
'Happy Olive and Allan,' thought Eveline,
as she rested for a minute on the arm
of Cameron, 'they may have as many round
dances as they choose without remark,
while mine, with <i>him</i>, must be few and far
between.'
</p>

<p>
Her dress was white silk, trimmed with
little laurel leaves and crowberry&mdash;the latter
a delicate attention to Evan, as it is the
badge of the Camerons.
</p>

<p>
'Will you wear my colours to-night?'
she asked, as they promenaded at that end
of the room which was furthest away from
'papa and mamma.'  She broke off a spray
and made him a button-hole.  'Allow me
to fix it for you,' said Eveline, and deftly
she put it in his lapel, while Evan's heart
thrilled to feel the touch of her beloved
hand&mdash;even though gloved&mdash;so near his heart, as
they swept into another waltz.
</p>

<p>
'Aberfeldie,' said the hostess to her
husband, 'I feel certain that Evan Cameron
is in love with our Eveline.'
</p>

<p>
Lord Aberfeldie had no doubt about it
whatever now, but he only said,
</p>

<p>
'He would be a fool to be otherwise.'
</p>

<p>
'But that is not what we seek!'
</p>

<p>
'Certainly not; but all young fellows
have fancies; and he will be gone from
this in a few hours now.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank Heaven, yes!' responded Lady
Aberfeldie, devoutly.
</p>

<p>
'By the way, why did you permit her to
wear those unlucky diamonds?'
</p>

<p>
'She pled so hard, and then the idea of
their bringing evil is so behind the age.'
</p>

<p>
'Behind the age or not, something
untoward or unlucky always accompanies their
appearance in public.  They should have
been sent to Bond Street long ago.'
</p>

<p>
And Lord Aberfeldie smiled on her
affectionately, as at that moment he could not
help thinking how handsome and young
his wife looked in her costume of rich ruby
velvet, trimmed at the square cut neck and
arms with the finest white old lace, while
jewels that an empress might have worn
glittered in her ears and hair.
</p>

<p>
Replacing sometimes the professional
musicians, making themselves useful at the
piano, and playing certainly good dance
music were two&mdash;the 'mermaids,' as Holcroft
called them&mdash;the minister's daughters,
who were usually so fond of warbling that
they 'were under the blue sea.'
</p>

<p>
He knew nothing of what Allan had
learned concerning him&mdash;of the light
Carslogie had thrown on his private life; thus,
whatever change had come over the spirit
of Olive's dream, he deemed it necessary to
ask her for, at least, one round dance as
usual; and Allan watched them with a
haughty grimace on his features as they
danced it in a silent manner that was peculiar
and rather oppressive to both.  The
moment it was over, and he handed her back to
a seat, Holcroft took refuge in the
refreshment-room, where Mr. Tappleton gave
him a foaming glass of sparkling champagne.
</p>

<p>
Young Cameron was rather grave, Allan
thought, but the former was oppressed by
one idea then, that on the morrow he would
have to report himself at the headquarters
of the Black Watch, and he gazed like one
in a dream at the dancers whirling round
him; so Allan took him to task and strove
to rally him.
</p>

<p>
'Why so sad, old fellow?  You're down
on your luck, somehow,' said he.
</p>

<p>
'Because, Graham,' replied Cameron,
with a forced smile, 'there are times when
I am inclined to ask with Mr. Mallock, "Is
life worth living?"'
</p>

<p>
'Of course it is&mdash;but how with you?'
</p>

<p>
'Well,' replied Cameron, with whom just
then one bitter thought was more than
usually keen, 'dipped nigh to sinking as
my place of Stratherroch is, I don't see so
much to live for, and certainly deuced little
to live upon.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't take this gloomy view, old fellow,'
said Allan, cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
'It is very well for you to take a
jolly view of the world, Allan&mdash;you, the son
of a peer, and engaged to&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Take heart, man; we've lots of life
before us&mdash;life in Egypt perhaps.  There is
Eveline sitting alone; take another turn
with her, and then we'll have some of
Mumms' extra dry together.'
</p>

<p>
Eveline had opened an album as Cameron
drew near her, but closed it instantly as
the first photo that met her eyes was a
fine cabinet one of Sir Paget.  There was
an expression of pensive sweetness in her
otherwise radiant face, for she, poor girl,
never for a moment forgot that a parting&mdash;too
probably a final one it might prove&mdash;was
close at hand now, and, after the two
past delightful months, how dreary would
the future seem!
</p>

<p>
'Are you tired?' said a tender voice in
her ear; 'it is our dance, I think&mdash;but
would you rather sit it out?'
</p>

<p>
'A little promenade rather.'
</p>

<p>
He bowed, and, rising, she took his
proffered arm.  They made a circuit of the
room once or twice, and then, lured no
doubt by the coolness and seclusion of a
long corridor, entered it, unnoticed as they
thought; but the watchful gaze of Lady
Aberfeldie had followed them.
</p>

<p>
There was much to see in this long,
stately, and vaulted corridor, and its deeply
embayed windows overlooking the rock on
which the oldest part of Dundargue is
perched.  Its floor was of <i>parqueterie</i>; its
walls of wainscot, with massively framed
old pictures; some trophies of arms and
family armour hung there, and the
windows were furnished with ancient stone
seats and modern stained glass, through
which the radiance of the setting sun
was contending with the dim shaded
lamps.
</p>

<p>
Specimens of unique china and frail
goblets of Venetian glass, with other objects
of 'bigotry and virtue,' as Holcroft had
called them, were there in oaken cabinets
and on exquisite brackets.  Among other
things, on a pedestal, skilfully stuffed, the
last golden eagle that had been shot at the
Birks of Aberfeldie, by the gun of Dugald
Glas, a glorious bird that measured five
feet from tip to tip of his shining pinions;
yet none of these things caught the
attention of the two promenaders.
</p>

<p>
Her hand was on his arm; involuntarily
that arm pressed the soft and tremulous
fingers which rested there, and in another
moment his hand stole over them without
their being withdrawn&mdash;nay, it seemed as
if their load became more heavy.
</p>

<p>
Eveline was not unaware that there
was something morally wrong in the
situation; but, then, 'the situation had its
charm.'
</p>

<p>
'Eveline!'
</p>

<p>
Cameron had never before ventured to
call her by her Christian name, nor, until
it passed his lips half unconsciously now,
had he an intention of so uttering it; but
that utterance seemed scarcely a new
revelation to the girl.
</p>

<p>
Soft and lovely was the shy smile upon
her upturned face as they stood within the
deep bay of a window.  Was it that smile,
or what, that dazed Evan Cameron and
swept his senses away; but he caught her
suddenly in his arms and kissed her lips
and eyes, whispering,
</p>

<p>
'Oh!  Eveline, my darling&mdash;my darling!'
</p>

<p>
And then there was a pause, full of
sighs of happiness.  'The stone was cast
into the water, and the still lake broke up
into a stormy sea, where there would be
peace and quiet no more!'  No more, at
least, unless the future held some
happiness for these two poor loving hearts.
</p>

<p>
'Have I done wrong?' said Cameron, in
a breathless voice, after a little time; 'God
knows I never meant that you should see
how dearly, how desperately, and how
hopelessly I love you when I let the precious
secret escape me as I did; but it is done
now.'
</p>

<p>
She was pale as death and trembling
violently, as she thought of her mother;
yet she nestled closely and clingingly to
him.
</p>

<p>
'You love me, Eveline?'
</p>

<p>
'Can you ask?' she whispered.  'Yes&mdash;oh,
yes&mdash;Evan.'
</p>

<p>
He was intoxicated, and drew her close
to him again.  Such a moment comes but
once in life&mdash;once only!
</p>

<p>
'Let us go now&mdash;we shall be missed,'
said Eveline.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, stay one moment longer, darling.'
</p>

<p>
'Mamma, if we could only get her to
be our friend, all might be right and go
well.'
</p>

<p>
'Even with my poverty, Eveline?'
</p>

<p>
'Don't call it so.  Yes, papa always
gives in to her in the long run.'
</p>

<p>
Cameron sighed.
</p>

<p>
'Are you two practising for amateur
theatricals, or admiring the stars through
the stained glass?' said the voice of Lord
Aberfeldie, suddenly.
</p>

<p>
We have said that the eyes of his wife
had followed the pair, and hence no doubt
his lordship's sudden appearance in the
dimly-lighted corridor.  Both were
painfully confused.
</p>

<p>
How much had Lord Aberfeldie overseen,
how much had he overheard, or how
little of both?  It was impossible for
them to guess, but he good-naturedly
affected not to see all that his mind
took in.
</p>

<p>
Cameron felt that he had nothing to
explain, to urge, or to utter, but bowed,
smiled a very hollow smile indeed, and led
his partner back to the dancing-room,
where neither waltzed more that evening,
as the impromptu affair was over, the
guests were departing, and Lord
Aberfeldie was beginning to think that the
diamonds of the legend were already
producing their evil results in this the first
untoward event in the young life of his
daughter.
</p>

<p>
Allan and Cameron, avoiding Holcroft,
sat long that night in the former's room
smoking and imbibing brandy-and-soda,
but no word escaped the lover of what
had passed in the corridor; and, sooth to
say, full of Olive and himself, Allan had
never missed the pair from the dancing-room.
</p>

<p>
Cameron was to leave Dundargue
betimes next morning, so he bade farewell
to his comrade, who charged him with
remembrances to 'all our fellows of the
Black Watch;' and anon Cameron found
himself alone with his own loving, exulting,
sad, and anxious thoughts, and with
the little bouquet&mdash;a dwarf laurel leaf and
sprig of crowberry&mdash;dearer to him then
than even his Victoria Cross!
</p>

<p>
Again and again did he rehearse that
sweet episode in the dimly-lit corridor, and
again and again in the time to come would
it return with sorrowful reiteration to his
heart and memory!
</p>

<p>
Eveline loved him!  Her own lips had
acknowledged it, her kisses seemed still to
linger on his lips; but to what end&mdash;my
God! he exclaimed, in bitterness of heart,
to what end?  Again and again he thought
over her plaintive and child-like wish, 'if
we could only get mamma to be our
friend,' and all that wish suggested.  Her
mother suspected much, he feared, and
that her father knew all.  Sir Paget, with
his colossal wealth, was looming in the
distance like a simoon to the newly
dawned love; and poor Evan could but
come to the terrible conclusion that, like
too many others, his penniless love could
only be a hopeless one.
</p>

<p>
So wore the night away&mdash;the last,
Cameron was assured, he would ever
spend in Dundargue; and morning came.
</p>

<p>
Unslept, Cameron made rapidly the
prosaic preparations for his departure, and
a valet had borne off his portmanteaus, rugs,
and gun-case to the entrance hall, where
the sleepy Mr. Tappleton and a wagonette
awaited him.
</p>

<p>
As he was about to descend the great,
silent staircase, suddenly Eveline, fully
dressed for the day and softly slippered,
stood before him, her mignonne face very
pale, and her soft hazel eyes inflamed by
past weeping.
</p>

<p>
'Evan!'
</p>

<p>
'My darling!'
</p>

<p>
No housemaids were about as yet,
and no prying eyes were there, nor had
Ronald Gair with his pipes blown <i>reveille</i>.
</p>

<p>
'I could not let you go without&mdash;without
one word of farewell,' she sobbed.
</p>

<p>
Long and mute was their embrace, and
the heart of Cameron swelled as if to
bursting with mingled love and gratitude.  He
pressed her to it.  It was their parting
embrace, and both seemed to feel in it
that which a writer has described as 'the
vibration of an agony.'
</p>

<p>
'I feel as if I were bereft of reason!' he
whispered.
</p>

<p>
'My poor Evan&mdash;my own dear love!'
cooed the girl.  One kiss more, and he was
gone.
</p>

<p>
When or where, if ever, would they meet
again?
</p>

<p>
Eveline had nervously and sedulously
avoided Sir Paget till the time of his
departure; and, when he did leave Dundargue
in the dawn, he was only seen off by the
old butler; but Evan Cameron had an
unexpected farewell caress, the memory of a
sad, soft, and clinging kiss that he was to
take away with him to what he deemed the
land of bondage, and tearful eyes watched
his wagonette as it passed down the
avenue and out upon the high-road that led
to the railway.
</p>

<p>
Evan looked backwards at the tall and
stately pile of Dundargue, on which the
rays of the rising sun shone redly, and
deep in his heart he envied Carslogie, who
was to remain behind for a couple of days'
shooting.  Yet wherefore should he envy
any man while Eveline loved him? was his
afterthought.
</p>

<p>
And she, poor girl, seemed to feel herself
left most terribly alone with all her
sorrow&mdash;alone amid her loving family and
splendid surroundings, and with Evan's
words of love lingering in her ear she was
soon bidden to school herself to think of
Sir Paget, and Sir Paget Puddicombe only!
'The human creature,' it has been written,
'who would have suited us to every fibre of
our being we have not found, or, having
found, have not possessed; but (perhaps)
undervalued, and so allowed to pass out
of our lives.'
</p>

<p>
These two suited each other 'to a fibre,'
as our author quaintly puts it, and in
perfect unanimity of sentiment; and yet for all
that they may be compelled to pass out of
each other's lives, and live those lives far,
far apart.
</p>

<p>
Under her mother's scrutiny Eveline
strove hard to dissemble, and on receiving
her morning kiss said,
</p>

<p>
'Well, mamma, no evil has come of the
wearing the diamonds&mdash;Dundargue has
not taken fire.'
</p>

<p>
'No, child&mdash;indeed, good has come!'
</p>

<p>
'How, mamma?'
</p>

<p>
'This morning's mail has brought an
enclosure for you&mdash;the formal proposal of
Sir Paget.'
</p>

<p>
Eveline was stricken dumb, but thought
to herself,
</p>

<p>
'Unhappy I&mdash;evil <i>has</i> come!'
</p>

<p>
And ere noon was passed she was taken
to task by her father in the library,
prompted by her mother, no doubt.
</p>

<p>
He drew her to him caressingly, and,
interlacing his fingers upon her head, drew
her soft cheek upon his breast.
</p>

<p>
'I think, Eveline,' said he, 'you may
know by this time how well I love
you.'
</p>

<p>
'I do, indeed, papa,' replied Eveline,
in a low voice, but feeling her heart
sink under this unusual prelude
nevertheless.
</p>

<p>
'And yet you have been deluding me.'
</p>

<p>
'Deluding you&mdash;I, papa?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, how?'
</p>

<p>
'By encouraging&mdash;pardon me, not that&mdash;rather
by permitting a visitor to encourage
certain hopes.  That, you know, it is
impossible I should view with favour.'
</p>

<p>
'You mean&mdash;you mean&mdash;&mdash;' stammered
Eveline, recalling the episode in the
corridor.
</p>

<p>
'Evan Cameron.'
</p>

<p>
'He is gone,' said she, with difficulty
restraining her tears.
</p>

<p>
'To darken the door of Dundargue no
more!  Not that I have any fault to find
with poor Cameron&mdash;a brave fellow who
has won his V.C., and is a Black Watchman
to boot; but he is Laird of Stratherroch
only in name; his purse does not
come up to the requisite standard, and
may never do so till both your heads are
grey; but he is gone, as you say, and we
shall think of him no more.  I have other
brighter, better, and richer views for you,
my dear child, and I hope you will not
disappoint us all.  Sir Paget loves you,
and you will think seriously over all
this?'
</p>

<p>
'How can I do otherwise, papa?' was
the dubious response, and the girl stole
away to her own room.  So wearing the
diamonds seemed only to be bringing
about a sudden crisis in the affairs of
herself and the banished Evan Cameron,
for such she deemed him.
</p>

<p>
And, ere she went to bed that night,
Eveline, poor girl, strove to pray that she
might have some guide or assistance up
the stony and thorny path which she
feared was before her now in life; but she
no longer now had the deep and unbroken
sleep that had ever been her lot the
moment her soft cheek touched the pillow.
Too nervous to sleep alone, she crept in
beside Olive, and, nestling her little face
in the white bosom of her cousin, wept
long and bitterly.
</p>

<p>
But events were now to occur that
caused even the brilliant proposal of Sir
Paget to be forgotten.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
